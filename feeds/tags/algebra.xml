\cos\), and \( \tan\) buttons, and their inverses (the \( \arcsin\), \( \arccos\), and
\( \arctan\) buttons). The display initially shows \( 0\). Given any positive
rational number \( q\), show that pressing some finite sequence of buttons will
yield the number \( q\) on the display. Assume that the calculator does real
number calculations with infinite precision. All functions are in terms of
radians.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define the set \(\sqrt\mathbb{Q} \coloneqq \{\,q &amp;gt; 0 \mid q^2 \in \mathbb{Q}\, \}
\supset \mathbb{Q}\). Let us then define the functions \(f,g: \sqrt\mathbb{Q}
\to\sqrt\mathbb{Q}\) from the calculator buttons. We have \[f(r)
    \coloneqq \tan\left(\arcsin\left(\cos\left(\arctan r\right)\right)\right) =
    \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \arctan r\right) = \frac{1} {r},\] and \[g(r)
\coloneqq \cos\left(\arctan r\right) = \frac{1} {\sqrt{1 + r^2}}.\] Obviously
\(f\) is bijective because its inverse is defined as itself. On the other hand,
\(g\) is also bijective as its inverse is defined as \(g^{-1}(r) =
\tan\left(\arccos r\right) = \frac{\sqrt{1-r^2}}{r}\) where \(r\) is in the range
of \(g\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose we are given some number \(q\in\sqrt\mathbb{Q}\) to compute. Starting at
\(0\), we can first apply \(\cos\) to get \(1\). We then show that it is possible to
iteratively apply \(f\) and \(g\) a finite number of times to achieve \(q\). Since
\(f\) and \(g\) are bijective, this is equivalent to showing that we can
iteratively apply inverses \(f^{-1}\) and \(g^{-1}\) a finite number of times to
get from \(q\) to \(1\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define a function \(c: \sqrt \mathbb{Q} \to \sqrt \mathbb{Q}\)  as 
\[ c(q) \coloneqq 
\begin{cases}
    f^{-1}(q) = \frac{1}{q} &amp;amp; \text{if } q &amp;gt; 1 \\
    1 &amp;amp; \text{if } q = 1 \\
    g^{-1}(q) = \frac{\sqrt{1-r^2}}{r} &amp;amp; \text{if } 1 &amp;gt; q &amp;gt; 0
\end{cases}. \] We prove that \[
\underbrace{c(c(c(... c}_n(q) ...))) = 1,\] for some positive integer \(n\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Letting \(q = \sqrt\frac{a}{b} = \frac{\sqrt a}{\sqrt b}\), for relatively prime
\(a, b \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\), we get the following cases: If \(a &amp;gt; b\), then \(c(q) =
c\left(\frac{\sqrt a}{\sqrt b}\right) = \frac{\sqrt b} {\sqrt a}\). If \(a=b\),
then \(c(q) = 1\). If \(b &amp;gt; a\), then \[ c(q) = c\left(\frac{\sqrt a}{\sqrt b}
    \right) = \frac{\sqrt{1 - \frac{a}{b}}}{\sqrt\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt {b
- a}}{\sqrt a} .\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't need to consider when \(a = b\), since it clearly satisfies our claim.
Now consider the sum of the squares of the numerator and the denominator when
\(q\) maps to \(c(q)\). For \(q,\) this sum is initially \(a+b\). For \(c(q)\), we either
get \(b+a\) or \(b - a + a = b\). Since \(b + a\), \(b \leq a + b\), notice that every
application of \(c\) monotonically decreases this sum by a positive integer.
It is also impossible to have infinite applications of the first case where
this sum doesn't decrease, so enough applications of \(c\) must bring the sum
down until \(a = b = 1\), at which point we are done.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want nestings of functions to yield rational values, so there are certain
cases that scream \(\textit{don't go there!}\) Expressions like \(\sin \sqrt k\),
\(\cos \sqrt k\), \(\arcsin \frac{m\pi}{n}\), \(\arccos \frac{m\pi} {n}\), etc.  are
such examples. In particular, we don't want ratios of the sides of a traingle
holding factors of \(\pi\). The angle conditions can be a little more relaxed
because we can define the angle whose slope is some rational \(q\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it's rather clear that there will be two kinds of numbers that appear on the
calculator. Those that represent angles and those that represent side ratios.
To get all the rational numbers, we will most likely focus on extracting it
from side ratios. There is also alternation between angle values and ratio
values. Therefore, it's practically impossible to have a repeat of the same
kind of trig function; it must alternate between \(\sin\), \(\cos\), and \(\tan\) to
one of their inverses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can try listing all possible ways of mapping these functions to see what
happens. Begin with some triangle side ratio \(t\) (not necessarily rational).
\(t\) can map to the following:
\[\begin{align*}
    f_1(t) &amp;amp;= \cos\left(\arctan t\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + t^2}} \\
    f_2(t) &amp;amp;= \sin\left(\arctan t\right) = \frac{t}{\sqrt{1 + t^2}} \\
    f_3(t) &amp;amp;= \tan\left(\arcsin t\right) = \frac{t}{\sqrt{1 - t^2}} \\
    f_4(t) &amp;amp;= \tan\left(\arccos t\right) = \frac{\sqrt{1 - t^2}}{t}
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will now try to get all the rationals. Consider what it means for some
rational number \(m\) to be \(\textit{computable}.\) If it were computable, then
persumably, from the above logic, it will come out of one of \(f_1(t)\), \(f_2(t)\),
\(f_3(t)\), or \(f_4(t)\). So let's just see what happens when we let \[ m = f_1(t)
. \]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the relation to hold, we must have
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad m = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + t^2}} \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad m^2\left(1 + t^2\right) = 1 \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad m^2t^2 = 1 - m^2 \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad t^2 = \frac{1 - m^2}{m^2} \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad t = \frac{\sqrt{1 - m^2}}{m},
\end{align*}\]
where each equation above is bidirectional since \(m\), \(t &amp;gt; 0\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if \(m\) is computable, then \(t\) must again be computable from one of \(f_1\),
\(f_2\), \(f_3\), or \(f_4\). We can then try the above method again, reach another
value \(t_1\), and send that back into, say \(f_1\), and so on. Once we hit a value
we know for certain is computable, then we know that unwinding all the
operations should give us a valid way to compute \(m\). This can be seen for the
value \(q = \frac{4}{5}\) below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[q = \frac{4}{5} \ {\color{blue} \to} \ \frac{3}{4} \ {\color{blue} \to} \
\frac{\sqrt 7}{3} \ {\color{blue} \to} \ \frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 7} \
{\color{blue} \to} \ \frac{\sqrt 5}{\sqrt 2} \ {\color{red} \to} \
\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 5} \ {\color{blue} \to} \ \frac{\sqrt 3}{\sqrt 2} \
{\color{red} \to} \ \frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 3} \ {\color{blue} \to} \
\frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \ {\color{blue} \to} \ 1 \ {\to} \ 0\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blue arrows indicate computing \(t\) from \(m\) as above. The red arrows
indicate computing the reciprocal.

sequence where each term in the original sequence is replaced by the arithmetic
mean of the term and the next term after it (where the last term is paired 
with the first term). If we start with a sequence of integers where no two
terms are equal, then prove that iteratively taking the mean-map of the
seqeunce will eventually produce non-integral terms.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will first prove the following assertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If \(q_1\), \(q_2\), \(\dots\), \(q_n\) \((n &amp;gt; 2)\) is a seqeunce of pairwise distinct
integers, then no matter how many times the mean-map is taken, a seqeuence will
never have all equal terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assume FTSOC that at some point all the terms become equal. Suppose the
sequence \(r_1\), \(r_2\), \(\dots\), \(r_n\) of integers are not all equal and the map
\[ \left(r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n\right) \mapsto \left(\frac{r_1+r_2} {2},
        \frac{r_2+r_3} {2}, \dots, \frac{r_n+r_1} {2}\right) \] yields
        \[\frac{r_1+r_2}{2} = \frac{r_2+r_3}{2} = \dots = \frac{r_n+r_1}{2}
        \iff r_1+r_2 = r_2+r_3 = \dots = r_n+r_1.\] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If \(n\) is odd, then we derive that \(r_1 = r_2 = \dots = r_n\), contradicting the
fact that they are not all equal. It suffices to then consider the case when
\(n\) is even.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If \(n\) is even, the above equality yields \(r_1 = r_3 = \dots = r_{n-1}\) and
\(r_2 = r_4 = \dots = r_n\). Suppose that \(x = r_1\) and \(y = r_2\). If \(x=y\), then
we get a contradiction as in the odd case, so consider \(x\neq y\). It suffices
to show that there cannot exist a sequence of integers \(s_1\), \(s_2\), \(\dots\),
\(s_n\) such that \[ \left(s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n\right) \mapsto \left(x, y, \dots,
x, y\right).\] If such a sequence exists, then \(s_1 + s_2 = s_3 + s_4 = \dots =
s_{n-1} + s_n = 2x\) and \(s_2 + s_3 = s_4 + s_5 = \dots = s_n + s_1 = 2y\). From
which it follows that \(\sum_{i=1}^n s_i = nx\) and \(\sum_{i=1}^n s_i = ny\)
respectively. However, since \(x \neq y\), this is clearly a contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we show that the sum of the pairwise distances between terms always
decreases. Let \(D_k\) be the sum after taking \(k\) mean-maps, we have
\[\begin{align*}
D_k &amp;amp;= \sum_{1\leq i\leq j\leq n} \left| q_i - q_j \right|\\
      &amp;amp;= 2\sum_{1\leq i\leq j\leq n} \frac{\left| q_i - q_j \right|}{2} \\
      &amp;amp;= \sum_{1\leq i\leq j\leq n} \frac{\left| q_i - q_j \right| + \left| q_{i+1} - q_{j+1} \right|}{2} \\
      &amp;amp;&amp;gt; \sum_{1\leq i\leq j\leq n} \left|\frac{q_i + q_{i+1}}{2} - \frac{q_j + q_{j+1}}{2}\right| \\
      &amp;amp;= D_{k+1},
\end{align*}\]
where indicies are taken cyclically modulo \(n\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since \(D_k \geq 0\) always decreases after taking a mean-map and the terms never
equate to one another (\(D_k \neq 0\) for each \(k\)), eventually \(D_k\) will stop
decreasing by integers, at which point it will decrease by a non-integer. The
distance between terms will then be non-integral, so some term must become
non-integral.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two key insights to the solution. The first insight is to come up
with the monovariant \(D_k\): the sum of the pairwise distances between terms.
Enough experimentation should reveal that the terms seem to &amp;quot;converge&amp;quot;
together after enough mean-maps. This then motivates the next key insight which
is to question whether all the terms become equal. This is important because
the equality case is a fixed point under a mean-map. To guarantee that we
always get non-integral terms, we must eliminate the potentially unwieldly
cases where the configurations somehow jumps to this fixed point. Once these
two insights are found however, the rest are minor details.

Let
\(H\) be the orthocentre, that is the point where the altitudes meet. Prove that
\[\frac{AB\cdot AC + BC\cdot BA + CA\cdot CB}{AH\cdot AD + BH\cdot BE + CH\cdot
CF} \leq 2.\]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should come back to clean up this solution because it's embarrassingly
long... But nonetheless, here is &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; solution:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) denote the lengths of the sides \(BC\), \(AC\), and \(AB\)
respectively. We begin with an obvious statement of AM-GM:
\[ab + bc + ca \leq a^2 + b^2 + c^2\] is equivalent to
\[\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} 
    &amp;amp;\leq \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{abc} \\
    &amp;amp;= \frac{\left(c^2 + b^2 - a^2\right) + \left(a^2 + c^2 - b^2\right) + \left(a^2 + b^2 - c^2\right)}{abc} \\
    &amp;amp;= 2\left(\frac{\cos A}{a} + \frac{\cos B}{b} + \frac{\cos C}{c}\right).
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now suppose \(x = c\cdot AF\), \(y = a\cdot BD\), and \(z = b\cdot CE\). We claim that
\[\begin{align*} 
    x\cos B\cos C &amp;amp;= \frac{xyz}{a^2bc},\\ 
    y\cos C\cos A &amp;amp;= \frac{xyz}{ab^2c}, \\
    z\cos A\cos B &amp;amp;= \frac{xyz}{abc^2}.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the symmetry of the configuration, WLOG it suffices to show that \(x\cos B\cos
C = \frac{xyz}{a^2bc}\). We have
\[\begin{align*}
    x\cos B\cos C 
    &amp;amp;= c\cdot AF\cdot\cos B\cos C \\
    &amp;amp;= (c\cos B)\cdot AF\cdot\cos C \\
    &amp;amp;= BD\cdot AF\cdot \frac{CE}{a} \\
    &amp;amp;= \frac{xyz}{a^2bc}.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiplying both sides of our derived inequality by \(\frac{xyz}{abc}\), we get 
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad \sum_{cyc}\frac{xyz}{a^2bc} \leq 2\sum_{cyc}\left(\frac{xyz}{a^2bc}\cos A\right)\\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad \sum_{cyc}x\cos B\cos C \leq 2(x+y+z)\cos A\cos B\cos C\\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad \frac{x}{\cos A} + \frac{y}{\cos B} + \frac{z}{\cos C} \leq 2(x+y+z),
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;where the cyclic sum is taken across the triplet \((a\), \(b\), \(c)\), the triplet
\((x\), \(y\), \(z)\), and the triplet \((A\), \(B\), \(C)\). Also note that \(0 &amp;lt; \cos A\),
\(\cos B\), \(\cos C &amp;lt; 1\) since \(ABC\) is acute. Now observe that \[ \frac{x}
{\cos A} = \frac{c\cdot AF}{\cos A} = \frac{c\cdot AF\cdot b}{AF} = bc,\] as
well as \(\frac{y}{\cos B}=ab\) and \(\frac{z}{\cos C} = ca\). Furthermore, it is
well known that the points \(F\), \(B\), \(D\), \(H\), the points \(H\), \(D\), \(C\), \(E\),
and the points \(E\), \(A\), \(F\), \(H\) are respectively concyclic, so by the power
of a point, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[\begin{align*}
    x &amp;amp;= c\cdot AF = AH\cdot AD, \\
    y &amp;amp;= a\cdot BD = BH\cdot BE, \\
    z &amp;amp;= b\cdot CE = CH\cdot CF.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substituting for the inequality above gives us \[ \frac{AB\cdot AC + BC\cdot BA
+ CA\cdot CB}{AH\cdot AD + BH\cdot BE + CH\cdot CF} \leq 2.\]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motivation for the solution is to think about how to interpret each product
that appears in the expression on the left-hand side. Initially, the products
\(AB\cdot AC\), \(BC\cdot BA\), and \(CA\cdot CB\) motivate us to think about area,
but this line of thought is shot down by the fact that \(\sin\) doesn't give us
the lengths we care about. The lengths we care about are the ones that appear
in the problem statement as well as the ones that can be derived from power of
a point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this train of thought however, one might reach the critical insight, which
is that \[AB\cdot AC\cdot\cos A = AB\cdot AC\cdot \frac{AE}{AB} = AE\cdot AC =
AH\cdot AD,\] where the same relation holds for the other angles. A natural
train of thought is: if \(\sin\) didn't work, why not \(\cos\)? Or one can realize
that \(AE\) is the projection of \(AB\) onto side \(AC\). Or instead of thinking
about areas, think about dot products. Any one of these should lead to this key
insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From here, the problem becomes substantially easier, so the rest is mostly
algebraic and geometric grunt work.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Canada 2015/1</title><id>https://nodalynn.com/canada-20151.html</id><author><name></name></author><updated>2024-02-20T01:32:00Z</updated><link href="https://nodalynn.com/canada-20151.html" rel="alternate" /><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Functional Inequality in N&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let \(\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\}\) be the set of positive integers.
Find all functions \(f\), defined on \(\mathbb{N}\) and taking values in \(\mathbb{N}
\), such that \((n-1)^2 &amp;lt; f(n)f(f(n)) &amp;lt; n^2 + n\) for every positive integer \(n\).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We claim that the only solution to \(f\) is \(f(n)=n\). Clearly, the inequality \[\
    (n-1)^2 &amp;lt; f(n)f(f(n)) = nf(n) = n^2 &amp;lt; n^2 + n
\] holds. We then show that \(f(n) = n\) for each \(n \in \mathbb{N}\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin, we prove by induction that \(f(n)\geq n\) for each \(n \in \mathbb{N}\).
The base case is \(n = 1\), where in which \(0 &amp;lt; f(1)f(f(1)) &amp;lt; 2\). This implies
that \(f(1) = 1\). Now suppose that \(f(k)\geq k\) for each \(1 \leq k \leq n - 1\),
and assume FTSOC that \(f(n) &amp;lt; n\). Since \(f(n)\) is in \(\mathbb{N}\), we know that 
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad f(n) &amp;lt; n \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad f(n) \leq n - 1 \\
    \implies&amp;amp;\quad f(n)^2 \leq (n-1)^2 &amp;lt; f(n)f(f(n)) \\
    \implies&amp;amp;\quad f(n) &amp;lt; f(f(n)).
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However note that because \(1 \leq f(n) \leq n-1\), by the hypothesis, \(f(f(n))
\geq f(n)\). This is a contradiction, so \(f(n) \geq n\) completes the induction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then show that \(f(n) \not&amp;gt; n\) for each \(n \in \mathbb{N}\). Suppose that \(f(n) &amp;gt;
n\). We then have
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad f(n) &amp;gt; n \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad f(n) \geq n + 1 \\
    \implies&amp;amp;\quad f(n)^2 \geq (n+1)^2 &amp;gt; n^2+n &amp;gt; f(n)f(f(n)) \\
    \implies&amp;amp;\quad f(n) &amp;gt; f(f(n)).
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But clearly, by the fact that \(f(n) \geq n\) for each \(n\), it must be that
\(f(f(n)) \geq f(n)\). This is a contradiction, so \(f(n) \not&amp;gt; n\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we have shown that \(f(n) = n\) for each \(n\), so the only function
\(f:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) must be \(f(n)=n\).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a typical garden-variety functional \(\sout{\text{equation}}\) inequality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observing that \(f\) is defined in \(\mathbb{N}\), we are motivated to test small
values of \(n\). At first, the experimentation will make the problem smell like
number theory, but after a while, we observe a recursive structure in the
bounds. From here, we guess that the answer is just \(n\), and the usage of
strong induction is highly motivated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only point of caution is to not get \(\textit{for each}\) mixed up with
\(\textit{for some}\). When we say that \(f(n) \geq n\), we must specify whether
this is true for some particular value of \(n\), or for each \(n \in \mathbb{N}\).
The consequences of getting this wrong are dire. For example, if \(f(n) \geq n\)
is for true for each \(n\), then we can safely conclude that \(f(f(n)) \geq f(n)\),
whereas if the argument is only true for some \(n\), we cannot make such
conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are lines of logic that are even more subtle than what is
described above. The famous one is the distinction between \(\textit{for each} \)
and \(\textit{for all}\). Intuitively, they seem interchangeable (\(\forall\)), but
they can mean completely different things depending on the context. For

point-wise trap. In these cases, leaning towards for each is a good bet.

Show
that the sum \[\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{a_i}{\prod_{j=1}^i (1+a_j)}\] is greater than
or equal to \(\frac{2^n - 1}{2^n}\).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define \[P_n \coloneqq \prod_{i=1} ^n(1+a_i) \quad\mathrm{and}\quad S_n
\coloneqq \sum_{i=1}^n \left[a_i\prod_{j=i+1}^n(a_j + 1)\right].\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We first show that \(S_n = P_n - 1\) by induction. The base case is
\[\begin{align*}
    S_2 &amp;amp;= a_1(1 + a_2) + a_2 \\
        &amp;amp;= a_1 + a_1a_2 + a_2 \\
        &amp;amp;= (1 + a_1)(1 + a_2) - 1 \\
        &amp;amp;= P_2 - 1.
\end{align*}\]
Now suppose that the claim is true for \(n=k\).
\[\begin{align*}
    S_{k+1} &amp;amp;= (1 + a_{k+1})(P_k - 1) + a_{k+1} \\
          &amp;amp;= (1 + a_{k+1})P_k - 1 - a_{k+1} + a_{k+1} \\
          &amp;amp;= P_{k+1} - 1,
\end{align*}\]
completes the induction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expression in the problem statement can be rewritten as \(\frac{S_n}{P_n}\).
Since \(a_1a_2\dots a_n = 1\), by the AM-GM inequality, \[ P_n = \prod_{i=1}
^n(1+a_i) \geq 2^n\sqrt{a_1a_2\dots a_n} = 2^n.\] Therefore,
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad\frac{1}{2^n} \geq \frac{1}{P_n} \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad 1 - \frac{1}{P_n} \geq 1 - \frac{1}{2^n} \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad \frac{P_n - 1}{P_n} \geq \frac{2^n - 1}{2^n} \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad \frac{S_n}{P_n} \geq \frac{2^n - 1}{2^n}.
\end{align*}\]

Find, with proof, all sequences \(x_1, x_2, \dots,
x_{n-1}\) of positive integers with the following three properties: (a) \(x_1 &amp;lt;
x_2 &amp;lt; \dots &amp;lt; x_{n-1}\); (b) \(x_i + x_{n-i} = 2n\) for all \(i = 1, 2, \dots, n-1\);
(c) given any two indices \(i\) and \(j\) (not necessarily distinct) for which \(x_i
+ x_j &amp;lt; 2n\), there is an index \(k\) such that \(x_i + x_j = x_k\).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We claim that the answer is only the sequence \(2, 4, 6, \dots, 2n - 2\). It is
easy to verify that all of the conditions are met. (a) and (b) are trivial. To
verify (c), note that if we divide each of the terms by \(2\), the resulting
sequence is simply the sequence of integers from \(1\) to \(n-1\). Since \(x_i + x_j
&amp;lt; 2n\) is equivalent to \(\frac{x_i}{2} + \frac{x_j}{2} &amp;lt; n\), we know that there
exists some index \(k\) for which \(\frac{x_i}{2} + \frac{x_j}{2} = \frac{x_k}{2}\),
where \(\frac{x_k}{2}\) is one of the integers between \(1\) and \(n-1\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then show that this is the only sequence that works. We claim that
\[\begin{align*} 
    x_1 + x_{n-2} &amp;amp;= x_{n-1} \\
    x_1 + x_{n-3} &amp;amp;= x_{n-2} \\
                  &amp;amp;\vdots \\
    x_1 + x_2 &amp;amp;= x_3.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin, note that \[x_1 &amp;lt; x_2 \iff x_1 + 2n - x_2 &amp;lt; 2n \iff x_1 + x_{n-2} &amp;lt;
2n. \] By condition (c), there exists some term whose sum is \(x_1 + x_{n-2}\).
Since \(x_1 + x_{n-2} &amp;gt; x_{n-2},\) the only possibility is \(x_{n-1}\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, observe that \(x_{n-3} &amp;lt; x_1 + x_{n-3} &amp;lt; x_1 + x_{n-2} = x_{n-1} &amp;lt; 2n\) so
it follows that \(x_1 + x_{n-3} = x_{n-2}\). Repeating the logic \(n-3\) more times,
we discover that the system of equations in the claim holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now show that \(x_2 = 2x_1\). We have
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad x_1 + x_{n-2} = x_{n-1} \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad x_1 + 2n - x_2 = 2n - x_1 \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad x_2 = 2x_1.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substituting the above into our equations and iteratively substituting
thereafter, we find that \(x_2 = 2x_1\), \(x_3 = 3x_1\), \(\dots\), \(x_{n-2} = (n-2)x_1\),
and \(x_{n-1} = (n-1)x_1\). Since \(2n - x_1 = x_{n-1} = (n-1)x_1\), we derive that
\(x_1 = 2\). Therefore the only sequence is \(2, 4, 6, \dots, 2n-2\).

&amp;lt; n - 1\), the rest of the solution becomes details. The motivation for the key
claim is to realize that the sum with the maximal gap between terms is
extremely (no pun intended) well-defined. Then, it's easy to \(\textit{tip}\) the
dominoe to get all the other equalities. This is a nice problem where analyzing
extremities does wonders.

    \iff&amp;amp;\quad \frac{1+zx+xy}{(1+y+z)^2} \geq \frac{x}{x+y+z},

so \[\sum_{cyc}\frac{1+zx+xy}{(1+y+z)^2} \geq \sum_{cyc}\frac{x}{x+y+z} =
1.\]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This inequality is homogenized, but manipulating it seems like a huge ordeal.
For example, if we think of adding the terms, we end up with some ugly 6th
degree polynomial on the numerator of the left-hand side. So this suggests to us
that dealing with each term individually is the way to go. One thing we can try
is bounding each individual term against some value. If the sum of these bounds
evaluates to some value greater than or equal to 1, we would be done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now to think up such value, we can think about what we don't want. We probably
don't want constants because it's likely that we would be able to adjust \(x\),
\(y\), \(z\) in such a way that allows that inequality to break. This means that
we'll have to have some combination of \(x\), \(y\), \(z\) in the bound. Another fact
that may help is that the terms in the left-hand side of the inequality are
cyclic, suggesting that the bounds are probably going to be cyclic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going through this train of thought, we may eventually find the following bounds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[\begin{align*}
\frac{1+xy+xz}{(1+y+z)^2} \geq \frac{x^k}{x^k + y^k + z^k}, \\
\frac{1+yz+yx}{(1+z+x)^2} \geq \frac{y^k}{x^k + y^k + z^k}, \\
\frac{1+zx+zy}{(1+x+y)^2} \geq \frac{z^k}{x^k + y^k + z^k},
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;where \(k\) is any real value. Now to determine \(k\), WLOG, note that \[(1+xy+xz)
(x^k + y^k + z^k) \geq x^k(1+y+z)^2\] must be true. This looks like weighted
AM-GM, so consider the following fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever we have \[a_{1}^{w_1}a_{2}^{w_2}\cdots a_{n}^{w_n} \leq w_1a_1 + w_2a_2
+ \cdots + w_na_n,\] the product of the exponent and the coefficient on each
variable equate on either sides. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we want the exact same thing to happen in our current situation.
Expanding and simplifying our inequality, we get &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;x^{k+1}y + x^{k+1}z + y^k+xy^{k+1} + xy^kz + z^k + xyz^k + xz^{k+1} \\
    \geq\ &amp;amp;x^ky^2 + z^2x^k + 2x^kzy + 2x^kz+ 2x^ky.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So using the trick on \(x\), we want 
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;(k+1)\cdot 1 + (k+1)\cdot 1 + 1\cdot 1 +1\cdot 1 + 1\cdot 1 + 1\cdot 1 \\
    =\ &amp;amp;k\cdot 1 + k\cdot 1 + k\cdot 2 + k\cdot 2 + k\cdot 2.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solving for \(k\), we get \(k=1\). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Letting \(k=1\) in our inequality and simplifying, we get \[x^2y + x^2z + y + z
\geq 2xz + 2xy.\] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is equivalent to \((x^2 + 1)(y + z) \geq 2x(y + z)\), which is the same as
\(x^2 + 1 \geq 2x,\) or \((x-1)^2 \geq 0\). To summarize, we have shown that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[\begin{align*} 
	\frac{1+xy+xz}{(1+y+z)^2} \geq \frac{x}{x + y +z}, \\ 
	\frac{1+yz+yx}{(1+z+x)^2} \geq \frac{y}{x + y + z}, \\ 
	\frac{1+zx+zy}{(1+x+y)^2} \geq \frac{z}{x + y + z}, 
\end{align*}\] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;so adding gives us the result. Also, note that although we have used AM-GM as a
motivator for finding the value of \(k\), it will not actually appear in a formal
write-up of the solution.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
