exactly one of them knew the other. Prove that there was someone in the
gathering that each person either knew or knew someone else who did.

person \(A\) is the one with the desired properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose the number of people who knew \(A\) was \(k\). If \(A\) did not know anyone
in the gathering, then everyone must have known \(A\) so our work is done.
Otherwise, \(A\) must have known someone else, say person \(B\). It then suffices
to show that \(B\) knew someone that knew \(A\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If \(B\) did not know anyone else who knew \(A\), then clearly, \(B\) must not have
known the \(k\) people who knew \(A\). Thus, \(B\) must have been known to the \(k\)
people who knew \(A\). And since \(A\) knew \(B\), in total, \(B\) must have been known
by \(k+1\) people. This contradicts the maximality of the number of people who
knew \(A\), so our assumption that \(B\) did not know anyone who knew \(A\)
is false. \(B\) must have known someone who knew \(A\).

object maximizes some function, and if said hypothesis is in fact true, the
solution should come out via assuming falsity and arriving at some
contradiction.

guarantee that it is connected?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is \(\tbinom{n-1}{2} + 1 = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1\) edges. We first
show that our answer indeed connects any given graph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider a graph \(G\) that has at least \(\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1\) edges and
assume FTSOC that there exists some \(k\)-vertex subgraph of \(G\) (\(k &amp;lt; n\)), say
\(G_k\), that is disconnected. The degree of each vertex in \(G_k\) must be at most
\(k-1\). Similarly, among the remaining \(n-k\) vertices, since none of them
connect to vertices in \(G_k\), each vertex will have a degree at most \(n-k-1\).
Now if the number of edges in \(G\) is maximized, by the handshake lemma, the
total number of edges in \(G\) must be at most \[ \frac{k(k-1)}{2} + \frac{(n-k)
    (n-k-1)} {2}.\] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, if \(E\) is the total number of edges in \(G\), we must have
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad \frac{k(k-1)}{2} + \frac{(n-k)(n-k-1)}{2} \geq E \geq \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1 \\
    \implies&amp;amp;\quad\frac{k(k-1)}{2} + \frac{(n-k)(n-k-1)}{2} \geq \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1 \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad\frac{n^2-(2k+1)n+2k^2}{2} \geq \frac{n^2-3n+4}{2} \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad k^2 - (k-1)n - 2 \geq 0 \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad k - 2 \geq (k-1)(n-k),
\end{align*}\]
which is a contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It now suffices to show that \(\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1\) is the minimum possible
bound. If the bound is \(\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = \tbinom{n-1}{2}\), then there is a
counterexample of \(G\) as the union of a \(K_{n-1}\) complete graph and one
disconnected vertex. On the other hand, there does exist a graph with
\(\tbinom{n-1}{2} + 1\) edges; \(G\) can be a \(K_{n-1}\) complete graph connected to
a distinct vertex by one edge.

It is possible
to draw the external tangents for each pair of circles so that they intersect at
a point. Prove that these points are collinear.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let the three circles be \(\omega_1\), \(\omega_2\), and \(\omega_3\), and their
centers be \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) respectively. Furthermore, let \(X\) be the
intersection of the tangents between \(\omega_1\), \(\omega_2\), and define \(Y\) and
\(Z\) similarly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WLOG, consider a single external tangent between, say, \(\omega_1\) and
\(\omega_2\). If we let the point of tangency on \(\omega_1\) be \(M\) and the point
of tangency on \(\omega_2\) be \(N\), then clearly, \(M\), \(N\), \(X\) are collinear.
Moreover, \(\measuredangle O_1MX = 90^\circ = \measuredangle O_2NX\), and \(O_1\),
\(O_2\), \(X\) are collinear. Thus, \(\triangle{O_1MX}\) is similar to
\(\triangle{O_2NX}\) with \[ \left|\frac{O_1X}{O_2X}\right| = \left|\frac{O_1M}
{O_2N}\right| = \frac{r_1}{r_2},\] where \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) are the radii of
\(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_2\) respectively. Thus, it also follows that
\(\left|\frac{O_2Y}{O_3Y}\right| =  \frac{r_2}{r_3} \), and \(\left|\frac{O_3Z}
{O_1Z}\right| =  \frac{r_3}{r_1}\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, consider the points \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\). If the points are
collinear, the theorem is obviously true; all the intersections lie on a line.
On the other hand, if the points form a triangle \(\triangle{O_1O_2O_3}\), then we
get a case of Menelaus' Theorem. \[\frac{O_1X}{XO_2}\cdot\frac{O_2Y}{YO_3}
\cdot\frac{O_3Z}{ZO_1} = \left(-\frac{r_1}{r_2}\right)\left(-\frac{r_2}
{r_3}\right)\left(-\frac{r_3}{r_1}\right) = -1,\]

positive integers such that \(p &amp;lt; q \leq n\) and \(p + q &amp;gt; n\). If \(\mathcal{R}
_n\) is the set of all ordered pairs \((p, q)\), prove that \[\sum_{(p,q) \in
\mathcal{R}_n} \frac{1}{pq} = \frac{1}{2}.\]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a set of positive integer pairs \(X = \{\left(a_1, b_1\right), \left(a_2,
b_2\right), \dots, \left(a_n, b_n\right)\}\), define the function \(\sigma:X\to
\mathbb{Q}\) as \[ \sigma(X) \coloneqq \sum_{(a,b) \in X}\frac{1}{ab}.\]
Moreover, define the sets \(A_n \coloneqq \{(p,q)\in \mathcal{R}_n \mid p+q&amp;gt;n+1\}
\), \(B_n \coloneqq \{(p,q) \in \mathcal{R}_n \mid p+q=n+1\}\), and \(N_n \coloneqq
\{(p, n) \in \mathcal{R}_n\} \). We derive a few properties of these sets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By construction, \(A_n\) and \(B_n\) are disjoint sets such that \(A_n \cup B_n =
\mathcal{R}_n\) (ie.  \(A_n = \mathcal{R}_n \setminus B_n\)). Furthermore, since
the sum of each pair in \(A_n\) is greater than \(n+1\) and follow the conditions
satisfied by \(\mathcal{R}_n\), the pairs appear in the set \(\mathcal{R}_{n+1}\).
In other words, \(A_n \subset \mathcal{R}_{n+1}\). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\(N_n\) is also the complement of \(A_{n-1}\) with respect to \(\mathcal{R}_{n}\).
\(A_{n-1} \subset \mathcal{R}_n\) from before, and each element of \(A_{n-1}\) is a
pair whose greatest element is at most \(n-1\). Likewise, \(N_n \subset \mathcal{R}
_n\), but each element of \(N_n\) is a pair whose greatest element is exectly \(n\).
These sets therefore disjointly make up \(\mathcal{R}_n\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have shown that \(A_n \sqcup B_n = \mathcal{R}_n = A_{n-1} \sqcup N_n\), so it
is clear that \[\sigma(A_n) + \sigma(B_n) = \sigma(\mathcal{R}_n) =
\sigma(A_{n-1}) + \sigma(N_n)\] for each \(n &amp;gt; 2\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then proceed to prove by induction that \(\sigma(\mathcal{R}_n) = \frac{1} {2}
\) for each \(n &amp;gt; 2\) (\(n=2\) is trivially true). The base case is \(n=3\), for which
\(\mathcal{R}_3 = \{(1,3), (2,3)\}\), and \(\sigma(\mathcal{R} _3) = \frac{1} {3}
+ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\). Now suppose that for some integer \(k &amp;gt; 2\),
\(\sigma(\mathcal{R}_k)=\frac{1}{2}\). By the equalities derived above, we have
\[\begin{align*}
    \sigma(\mathcal{R}_{k+1}) &amp;amp;= \sigma(A_k) + \sigma(N_{k+1}) \\
               &amp;amp;= \sigma(\mathcal{R}_k) - \sigma(B_k) + \sigma(N_{k+1}) \\
               &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2} + \sigma(N_{k+1}) - \sigma(B_k).
\end{align*}\]
Thus, it suffices to show that \(\sigma(N_{k+1}) = \sigma(B_k)\) for each \(k&amp;gt;2\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now prove a short lemma. For positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) such that
\(a+b=m\), \(a\perp m \iff a\perp b \iff b\perp m\). By symmetry, it suffices to
prove that \(a\perp m\) if and only if \(a\perp b\). The Euclidean algorithm yields
\(\gcd(m, a) = \gcd(a, m - a = b)\), so if one of them is \(1\) then so is the
other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let us now compute \(\sigma(N_{k+1})\). We have 
\[\begin{align*}
\sigma(N_{k+1}) &amp;amp;= \sum_{\substack{0&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;k+1\\ p\perp k+1}} \frac{1}{p(k+1)} \\
           &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2}\cdot\sum_{\substack{0&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;k+1\\ p\perp k+1}}\left(\frac{1}{p(k+1)}+\frac{1}{(k+1-p)(k+1)}\right) \\
           &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2}\cdot\sum_{\substack{0&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;k+1\\ p\perp k+1}}\frac{1}{p(k+1-p)} \\
           &amp;amp;= \sum_{\substack{0&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;q\leq k\\ p+q=k+1\\ p\perp q}}\frac{1}{pq} \\
           &amp;amp;= \sum_{\substack{(p,q)\in \mathcal{R}_k\\ p+q=k+1}}\frac{1}{pq} = \sigma(B_k),
\end{align*}\]
where our lemma is used on the second and the fourth equalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have shown that \(\sigma(N_{k+1})=\sigma(B_k)\) for each \(k&amp;gt;2\), completing the
proof.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main difficulty of this problem is to get the whole induction to go
through.  We want to somehow link the \(n=k\) case to the \(n=k+1\) case, but
simple computations of the sum do not yield anything fruitful. This motivates
us to analyze the actual pairs instead. We see that some of the pairs appear
multiple times across \(n\), so we question whether we have anything useful to
say about them. One of the key realizations is to notice that if pair \((p, q)
\in \mathcal{R}_k\) has the property \(p+q&amp;gt;k+1\), then that pair carries over to
the next sum for \(n=k+1\).  It is then easy to realize that the rest of the
pairs that make up \(\mathcal{R}_{k+1}\) have largest element \(k+1\). This
motivates the three sets we defined in the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, the rest of the problem simplifies to showing that the sums from
these sets are equal. The insight here is that numbers relatively prime to some
integer \(k\) come in pairs that sum to \(k\). This is the lemma we proved in the
solution.

horizontally or vertically. In order to open it, all the keys must be vertically
oriented. When a key is switched to another position, all the other keys in the
same row and column automatically switch their positions too. Show
that no matter what the starting positions are, it is always possible to open
this lock. (Only one key can be switched at a time.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It suffices to show that there exists a sequence of moves such that any of the
keys can be switched individually without altering the rest of the
configuration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select any key to individually switch and call this the \(\textit{main}\) key.
Now consider all the keys that occupy the same row or the same column as this
key. Together, there are \(7\) such keys including the main key. We claim that
our sequence of moves consists of switching each of these keys once regardless
of order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prove that this works, we count the number of times each key gets switched.
There are three cases to consider: the main key, the \(6\) other keys to switch,
and the rest of the keys left untouched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the main key, the position changes each time we switch one of the \(7\) keys.
Since \(7\) is odd, by the end of the operation, it will switch to a different
position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, for the other \(6\) keys, a key either shares the same row or the same
column as the main key. WLOG, if the key shares the same row with the main key,
then when the \(7\) keys get switched, only the keys in the same row affect our
key. Hence, any such key gets switched \(4\) times, returning them to their
original positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, for the untouched keys, a key will share the same row with one of the
\(6\) keys, and share the same column with another of the \(6\) keys. This means
that untouched keys are switched a total of \(2\) times, so they too will switch
back to their original positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have shown that only the main key gets switched to a different position
after the sequence of moves, so we are done.

Fibonacci number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, let us compute the first two values of \((a_n)\). When \(n=1\), we have the
subsets \(\{\emptyset, \{1\}\}\), so \(a_1=2\) and when \(n=2\), we have the subsets
\(\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}\}\), so \(a_2=3\). It now suffices to prove that \(a_n = a_{n-1} +
a_{n-2}\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the numbers \(1\), \(2\), \(\dots\), \(n\). We do casework on whether to
include or exclude \(n\) in our subset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose we include \(n\). This means that we cannot include \(n - 1\). The
exclusion of \(n-1\) does not affect the inclusion of the rest of the numbers
between \(1\) and \(n-2\), so there will be \(a_{n-2}\) subsets that can be formed
with these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if we exclude \(n\), then this does not affect the inclusion of
the rest of the numbers from \(1\) to \(n-1\). Therefore, there will be \(a_{n-1}\)
subsets that can be formed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have therefore shown that \(a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\), so \(a_{n} = F_{n+2}\).

integer \(r\) such that \(k = 2^t\cdot r\) for some non-negative integer \(t\). We
partition the positive integers from \(1\) to \(2n\) based on their odd root. Since
there are \(n\) odd positive integers, clearly there will be \(n\) partitions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now claim that any two numbers in the same partition have the property that
one divides the other. Suppose WLOG that positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) have the
same odd root \(r_0\) and \(a &amp;gt; b\). We can write \(a\) as \(2^{a_0}\cdot r_0\) and \(b\)
as \(2^{b_0} \cdot r_0\) for some non-negative integers \(a_0\) and \(b_0\). Since \(a

2^{b_0} \cdot r_0 = 2^{a_0 - b_0}\cdot b.\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the \(n\) partitions, \(n+1\) numbers are chosen, so by the pigeonhole
principle, there must exist a partition in which two numbers are chosen.

sequence where each term in the original sequence is replaced by the arithmetic
mean of the term and the next term after it (where the last term is paired 
with the first term). If we start with a sequence of integers where no two
terms are equal, then prove that iteratively taking the mean-map of the
seqeunce will eventually produce non-integral terms.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will first prove the following assertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If \(q_1\), \(q_2\), \(\dots\), \(q_n\) \((n &amp;gt; 2)\) is a seqeunce of pairwise distinct
integers, then no matter how many times the mean-map is taken, a seqeuence will
never have all equal terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assume FTSOC that at some point all the terms become equal. Suppose the
sequence \(r_1\), \(r_2\), \(\dots\), \(r_n\) of integers are not all equal and the map
\[ \left(r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n\right) \mapsto \left(\frac{r_1+r_2} {2},
        \frac{r_2+r_3} {2}, \dots, \frac{r_n+r_1} {2}\right) \] yields
        \[\frac{r_1+r_2}{2} = \frac{r_2+r_3}{2} = \dots = \frac{r_n+r_1}{2}
        \iff r_1+r_2 = r_2+r_3 = \dots = r_n+r_1.\] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If \(n\) is odd, then we derive that \(r_1 = r_2 = \dots = r_n\), contradicting the
fact that they are not all equal. It suffices to then consider the case when
\(n\) is even.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If \(n\) is even, the above equality yields \(r_1 = r_3 = \dots = r_{n-1}\) and
\(r_2 = r_4 = \dots = r_n\). Suppose that \(x = r_1\) and \(y = r_2\). If \(x=y\), then
we get a contradiction as in the odd case, so consider \(x\neq y\). It suffices
to show that there cannot exist a sequence of integers \(s_1\), \(s_2\), \(\dots\),
\(s_n\) such that \[ \left(s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n\right) \mapsto \left(x, y, \dots,
x, y\right).\] If such a sequence exists, then \(s_1 + s_2 = s_3 + s_4 = \dots =
s_{n-1} + s_n = 2x\) and \(s_2 + s_3 = s_4 + s_5 = \dots = s_n + s_1 = 2y\). From
which it follows that \(\sum_{i=1}^n s_i = nx\) and \(\sum_{i=1}^n s_i = ny\)
respectively. However, since \(x \neq y\), this is clearly a contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we show that the sum of the pairwise distances between terms always
decreases. Let \(D_k\) be the sum after taking \(k\) mean-maps, we have
\[\begin{align*}
D_k &amp;amp;= \sum_{1\leq i\leq j\leq n} \left| q_i - q_j \right|\\
      &amp;amp;= 2\sum_{1\leq i\leq j\leq n} \frac{\left| q_i - q_j \right|}{2} \\
      &amp;amp;= \sum_{1\leq i\leq j\leq n} \frac{\left| q_i - q_j \right| + \left| q_{i+1} - q_{j+1} \right|}{2} \\
      &amp;amp;&amp;gt; \sum_{1\leq i\leq j\leq n} \left|\frac{q_i + q_{i+1}}{2} - \frac{q_j + q_{j+1}}{2}\right| \\
      &amp;amp;= D_{k+1},
\end{align*}\]
where indicies are taken cyclically modulo \(n\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since \(D_k \geq 0\) always decreases after taking a mean-map and the terms never
equate to one another (\(D_k \neq 0\) for each \(k\)), eventually \(D_k\) will stop
decreasing by integers, at which point it will decrease by a non-integer. The
distance between terms will then be non-integral, so some term must become
non-integral.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two key insights to the solution. The first insight is to come up
with the monovariant \(D_k\): the sum of the pairwise distances between terms.
Enough experimentation should reveal that the terms seem to &amp;quot;converge&amp;quot;
together after enough mean-maps. This then motivates the next key insight which
is to question whether all the terms become equal. This is important because
the equality case is a fixed point under a mean-map. To guarantee that we
always get non-integral terms, we must eliminate the potentially unwieldly
cases where the configurations somehow jumps to this fixed point. Once these
two insights are found however, the rest are minor details.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
