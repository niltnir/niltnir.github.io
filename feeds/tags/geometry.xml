circumscribed circle, and let \(A_1\), \(B_1\), and \(C_1\) be the midpoints of sides
\(BC\), \(CA\), and \(AB\), respectively. Point \(A_2\) is located on the ray \(OA_1\) so
that \(OAA_1\) is similar to \(OA_2A\). Points \(B_2\) and \(C_2\) on rays \(OB_1\) and
\(OC_1\), respectively, are defined similarly. Prove that lines \(AA_2\), \(BB_2\),
and \(CC_2\) are concurrent, i.e. these three lines intersect at a point.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main claim is that \(AA_2\), \(BB_2\), and \(CC_2\) are the symmedians of
\(\triangle{ABC}\). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WLOG, we show that \(AA_2\) is the \(A\)-symmedian of \(\triangle{ABC}\). By the
symmedian construction, it suffices to prove that \(\angle OBA_2 = 90^\circ =
\angle OCA_2\). The given similar triangles yield \[ OA_1 \cdot OA_2 = OA^2 =
OB^2.\] Then, we have \(OB^2 = OA_1 \cdot OA_2 \iff \frac{OB}{OA_1} = \frac{OA_2}
{OB}\) and \(\angle BOA_1 = \angle BOA_2\). Hence, triangles \(BOA_1\) and \(A_2OB\)
are similar. Since \(OA_1\) is the perpendicular bisector of side \(\overline{BC}\),
\(\angle OBA_2 = 90^\circ\). These arguments can be repeated for \(\angle OCA_2\),
so we get \(\angle OBA_2 = 90^\circ = \angle OCA_2\) as desired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\(BB_2\) and \(CC_2\) are then also symmedians of \(\triangle{ABC}\) and it is well
known that the symmedians of a triangle concur at the Lemoine point.

\(\angle OQP = 90^\circ\). As such, \(Q\) lies on the circle whose diameter is
\(OP\). This is true regardless of the choice of \(q,\) so any midpoint \(Q\) will
lie on the circle with diameter \(OP\).

It is possible
to draw the external tangents for each pair of circles so that they intersect at
a point. Prove that these points are collinear.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let the three circles be \(\omega_1\), \(\omega_2\), and \(\omega_3\), and their
centers be \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) respectively. Furthermore, let \(X\) be the
intersection of the tangents between \(\omega_1\), \(\omega_2\), and define \(Y\) and
\(Z\) similarly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WLOG, consider a single external tangent between, say, \(\omega_1\) and
\(\omega_2\). If we let the point of tangency on \(\omega_1\) be \(M\) and the point
of tangency on \(\omega_2\) be \(N\), then clearly, \(M\), \(N\), \(X\) are collinear.
Moreover, \(\measuredangle O_1MX = 90^\circ = \measuredangle O_2NX\), and \(O_1\),
\(O_2\), \(X\) are collinear. Thus, \(\triangle{O_1MX}\) is similar to
\(\triangle{O_2NX}\) with \[ \left|\frac{O_1X}{O_2X}\right| = \left|\frac{O_1M}
{O_2N}\right| = \frac{r_1}{r_2},\] where \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) are the radii of
\(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_2\) respectively. Thus, it also follows that
\(\left|\frac{O_2Y}{O_3Y}\right| =  \frac{r_2}{r_3} \), and \(\left|\frac{O_3Z}
{O_1Z}\right| =  \frac{r_3}{r_1}\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, consider the points \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\). If the points are
collinear, the theorem is obviously true; all the intersections lie on a line.
On the other hand, if the points form a triangle \(\triangle{O_1O_2O_3}\), then we
get a case of Menelaus' Theorem. \[\frac{O_1X}{XO_2}\cdot\frac{O_2Y}{YO_3}
\cdot\frac{O_3Z}{ZO_1} = \left(-\frac{r_1}{r_2}\right)\left(-\frac{r_2}
{r_3}\right)\left(-\frac{r_3}{r_1}\right) = -1,\]

A circle with center \(O\) is
tangent to side \(BC\) at point \(P\) and tangent to the arc \(BC\) of \(\Gamma\) not
containing \(A\) at point \(Q\). Prove that if \(\angle{BAO} = \angle{CAO}\), then
\(\angle{PAO} = \angle{QAO}\).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let \(M\) be the midpoint of arc \(BC\) containing \(A\), \(N \neq A\) be the
intersection of line \(AO\) with \(\Gamma\), \(O_{\Gamma}\) be the center of \(\Gamma\),
and \(\omega\) be the circle with center \(O\) described in the problem statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\(M\), \(P\), and \(Q\) are then collinear by the so called \(\textit{shooting lemma}\),
which we prove as follows. It is clear that there exists a homothety mapping
\(\omega\) to \(\Gamma\), since \(O_\Gamma\), \(O\), and \(Q\) are collinear, \(MO_{\Gamma}
\) is parallel to \(PO\) (both perpendicular to \(\overline{BC})\), and both
\(\triangle{MO_{\Gamma}Q}\) and \(\triangle{POQ}\) are isosceles. Consequently, \(M\),
\(P\), and \(Q\) are collinear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now claim that \(M\), \(O_{\Gamma}\), \(N\) are also collinear. We have \[
\measuredangle CBN = \measuredangle CAN = \measuredangle CAO = \measuredangle
OAB = \measuredangle NAB = \measuredangle NCB, \] so \(N\) must be the midpoint of
arc \(\widehat{BC}\) not containing \(A\). Thus, \(MN\) is simply the diameter of
\(\Gamma\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now use the above to show that \(A\), \(P\), \(O\), \(Q\) are concyclic. Using the
homothety defined above, we see that \[ \measuredangle OPQ = \measuredangle
O_{\Gamma}MQ = \measuredangle NMQ = \measuredangle NAQ = \measuredangle OAQ, \]
so \(A\), \(P\), \(O\), \(Q\) are concyclic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, since \(\triangle{OPQ}\) is isosceles, \[ \measuredangle QAO =
\measuredangle QPO = \measuredangle OQP = \measuredangle OAP.  \]

that \(A\), \(P\), \(O\), and \(Q\) are concyclic. This requires discovering point \(N\)
along the way, which is both the antipode of \(M\) and the intersection of \(AO\)
with \(\Gamma\).

Let
\(H\) be the orthocentre, that is the point where the altitudes meet. Prove that
\[\frac{AB\cdot AC + BC\cdot BA + CA\cdot CB}{AH\cdot AD + BH\cdot BE + CH\cdot
CF} \leq 2.\]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should come back to clean up this solution because it's embarrassingly
long... But nonetheless, here is &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; solution:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) denote the lengths of the sides \(BC\), \(AC\), and \(AB\)
respectively. We begin with an obvious statement of AM-GM:
\[ab + bc + ca \leq a^2 + b^2 + c^2\] is equivalent to
\[\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} 
    &amp;amp;\leq \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{abc} \\
    &amp;amp;= \frac{\left(c^2 + b^2 - a^2\right) + \left(a^2 + c^2 - b^2\right) + \left(a^2 + b^2 - c^2\right)}{abc} \\
    &amp;amp;= 2\left(\frac{\cos A}{a} + \frac{\cos B}{b} + \frac{\cos C}{c}\right).
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now suppose \(x = c\cdot AF\), \(y = a\cdot BD\), and \(z = b\cdot CE\). We claim that
\[\begin{align*} 
    x\cos B\cos C &amp;amp;= \frac{xyz}{a^2bc},\\ 
    y\cos C\cos A &amp;amp;= \frac{xyz}{ab^2c}, \\
    z\cos A\cos B &amp;amp;= \frac{xyz}{abc^2}.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the symmetry of the configuration, WLOG it suffices to show that \(x\cos B\cos
C = \frac{xyz}{a^2bc}\). We have
\[\begin{align*}
    x\cos B\cos C 
    &amp;amp;= c\cdot AF\cdot\cos B\cos C \\
    &amp;amp;= (c\cos B)\cdot AF\cdot\cos C \\
    &amp;amp;= BD\cdot AF\cdot \frac{CE}{a} \\
    &amp;amp;= \frac{xyz}{a^2bc}.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiplying both sides of our derived inequality by \(\frac{xyz}{abc}\), we get 
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad \sum_{cyc}\frac{xyz}{a^2bc} \leq 2\sum_{cyc}\left(\frac{xyz}{a^2bc}\cos A\right)\\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad \sum_{cyc}x\cos B\cos C \leq 2(x+y+z)\cos A\cos B\cos C\\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad \frac{x}{\cos A} + \frac{y}{\cos B} + \frac{z}{\cos C} \leq 2(x+y+z),
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;where the cyclic sum is taken across the triplet \((a\), \(b\), \(c)\), the triplet
\((x\), \(y\), \(z)\), and the triplet \((A\), \(B\), \(C)\). Also note that \(0 &amp;lt; \cos A\),
\(\cos B\), \(\cos C &amp;lt; 1\) since \(ABC\) is acute. Now observe that \[ \frac{x}
{\cos A} = \frac{c\cdot AF}{\cos A} = \frac{c\cdot AF\cdot b}{AF} = bc,\] as
well as \(\frac{y}{\cos B}=ab\) and \(\frac{z}{\cos C} = ca\). Furthermore, it is
well known that the points \(F\), \(B\), \(D\), \(H\), the points \(H\), \(D\), \(C\), \(E\),
and the points \(E\), \(A\), \(F\), \(H\) are respectively concyclic, so by the power
of a point, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[\begin{align*}
    x &amp;amp;= c\cdot AF = AH\cdot AD, \\
    y &amp;amp;= a\cdot BD = BH\cdot BE, \\
    z &amp;amp;= b\cdot CE = CH\cdot CF.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substituting for the inequality above gives us \[ \frac{AB\cdot AC + BC\cdot BA
+ CA\cdot CB}{AH\cdot AD + BH\cdot BE + CH\cdot CF} \leq 2.\]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motivation for the solution is to think about how to interpret each product
that appears in the expression on the left-hand side. Initially, the products
\(AB\cdot AC\), \(BC\cdot BA\), and \(CA\cdot CB\) motivate us to think about area,
but this line of thought is shot down by the fact that \(\sin\) doesn't give us
the lengths we care about. The lengths we care about are the ones that appear
in the problem statement as well as the ones that can be derived from power of
a point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this train of thought however, one might reach the critical insight, which
is that \[AB\cdot AC\cdot\cos A = AB\cdot AC\cdot \frac{AE}{AB} = AE\cdot AC =
AH\cdot AD,\] where the same relation holds for the other angles. A natural
train of thought is: if \(\sin\) didn't work, why not \(\cos\)? Or one can realize
that \(AE\) is the projection of \(AB\) onto side \(AC\). Or instead of thinking
about areas, think about dot products. Any one of these should lead to this key
insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From here, the problem becomes substantially easier, so the rest is mostly
algebraic and geometric grunt work.

then compute the value of \(\angle XZY\):

               &amp;amp;= 180^\circ - (\angle EYZ + \angle ZEY) \\

               &amp;amp;= 180^\circ - (\angle DYH + \angle FXB + \angle DCB) \\
               &amp;amp;= 180^\circ - \left[\frac{1}{2}\left(\widehat{CD} - \widehat{AB}\right) + \left(\widehat{BC} - \widehat{DA}\right) + \angle DCB\right] \\
               &amp;amp;= 180^\circ - \left(\frac{1}{2}\widehat{BCD} - \frac{1}{2}\widehat{DAB} + \angle DCB \right) \\
               &amp;amp;= 180^\circ - \left(\frac{1}{2}\angle BAD - \frac{1}{2}\angle DCB + \angle DCB \right) \\
               &amp;amp;= 180^\circ - \frac{1}{2}\left(\angle BAD + \angle DCB \right) \\
               &amp;amp;= 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus we deduce that \(XZ\) is perpendicular to \(YZ\). Now consider \(\triangle{HXG}\)
and \(\triangle{EYF}\). Segments \(\overline{XZ}\) and \(\overline{YZ}\) are each both
an angle bisector and an altitude of \(\triangle{HXG}\) and \(\triangle{EYF}\)
respectively. It follows that the triangles are both isosceles, and in
particular, \(XZ\) bisects \(\overline{HG}\) and \(YZ\) bisects \(\overline{EF}\). \(E\)
and \(F\) are on \(XZ\), and \(G\) and \(H\) are on \(YZ\) respectively, so the result has

\(\measuredangle PAH' = \measuredangle CAH\), so \(AH'\) is the isogonal of \(AH\)

have gradually taken over my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After publishing the initial site, I decided to take a break from code to do
something else for a while. At first I was considering drawing sketches or
solving combinatorics problems, but strangely enough, I found myself picking up
a geometry book I bought some years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've read my math page, you'll know that I enjoy discrete math, so it was
quite odd for me to suddenly crave for geometry. Perhaps the appeal was the
pretty diagrams I got to draw with compass and straightedge. I admit, there is
a certain meditative quality in patiently turning words into pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I made my way through the book and got acquainted with propositions,
theorems, and lemmas as I worked them out on sheets of paper. Eventually I
started solving some exercises, and soon I was craving to get past the theory
to dive right into the wild west of exhilarating problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One fun problem&lt;label for=&quot;sn-914751-453890&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-914751-453890&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;For those impatiently curious, the solution is on this site.&lt;/span&gt; I was immediately confronted with was the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let \(C\) be a circle and \(P\) a given point in the plane. Each line
through \(P\) which intersects \(C\) determines a chord of \(C\). Show that the
midpoints of these chords lie on a circle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of Euclidean geometry lies in its simple character. There are no
crazy equations&lt;label for=&quot;sn-693771-234791&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-693771-234791&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;With the exceptions of rectilinear coordinates, complex numbers, barycentric coordinates, linear algebra, etc.&lt;/span&gt;, no confusing
objects, no fancy notation, yet results are often astonishing. It's no wonder
that geometry is called the &lt;strong&gt;king&lt;/strong&gt; of mathematics. And strangely, the process
of exploring and solving problems synthetically can often feel close to
discrete math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, geometry gets a bad rap in conventional education and other
academic institutions. It's often written off as &amp;quot;useless&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;trivial&amp;quot; by
many. In fact, Euclidean geometry is a dead topic among &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; professional
mathematicians despite its historical origins. In a way though, the field is a
hidden gem—detached from the world, only showing itself to those who seek it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's often hard as a beginner to recognize the depth to which something simple
manifests. When I tried getting into geometry years ago, the theory seemed too
&amp;quot;fundamental&amp;quot; and the problems too &amp;quot;similar&amp;quot;. Only now do I appreciate the true
depth that this humble subject has to offer. This is especially true after
solving many beautifully crafted Olympiad problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, now that I have pages filled with diagrams of problems and solutions,
it only worsens my ever-increasing queue of &amp;quot;math to convert to LaTeX&amp;quot;.
Diagrams are also more tedious because it requires additional tools like
Asymptote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, geometry has a new place in my heart. Gone are the days of &lt;em&gt;just
another find the length problem&lt;/em&gt;. It's a field where more of its magic is
revealed to you the deeper you go. But go too far, and you'll start looking for
concyclic points in stars and raindrops.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-638054-186245&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-638054-186245&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;This is the famous Tetris effect. My record is having diagrams appear in my dream. Besides geometry and Tetris, I've also dreamt of Lisp code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much what I've been up to lately. Excuse my bad writing, this is
being written at 4 AM in the morning (revised a day later). ;p&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
