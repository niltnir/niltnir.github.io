have gradually taken over my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After publishing the initial site, I decided to take a break from code to do
something else for a while. At first I was considering drawing sketches or
solving combinatorics problems, but strangely enough, I found myself picking up
a geometry book I bought some years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've read my math page, you'll know that I enjoy discrete math, so it was
quite odd for me to suddenly crave for geometry. Perhaps the appeal was the
pretty diagrams I got to draw with compass and straightedge. I admit, there is
a certain meditative quality in patiently turning words into pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I slowly made way through the book, propositions, theorems, and lemmas flew
onto sheets of paper. And as I got acquainted with these objects, I started
solving some exercises. Soon I was craving to get past the theory to dive
straight into the wild west of exhilarating problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One fun problem&lt;code&gt;(sidenote &amp;quot;The solution can be found elsewhere. If motivation permits, I will post the solution on this site.&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; I was immediately confronted
with was the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Given a circle and a point inside of it, take all the chords through the point
and aggregate their midpoints. Prove that the resulting figure is a circle with
its diameter defined between the point and the center of the circle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of Euclidean geometry lies in its simple character. There are no
crazy equations&lt;code&gt;(sidenote &amp;quot;With the exceptions of rectilinear coordinates, complex numbers, barycentric coordinates, linear algebra, etc.&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;, no confusing
objects, no fancy notation, yet results are often astonishing. It's no wonder
that geometry is called the &lt;strong&gt;king&lt;/strong&gt; of mathematics. I guess in this sense,
it's closer to the elegance of discrete math than it is to, say, algebra or
analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, geometry gets a bad rap in conventional education and other
academic institutions. It's often written off as &amp;quot;useless&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;trivial&amp;quot; by
many. In fact, Euclidean geometry is a dead topic among professional
mathematicians despite its historical origins. In a way though, the field is a
hidden gem—detached from the world, only showing itself to those who seek it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's often hard as a beginner to recognize the depth to which something simple
manifests. When I tried getting into geometry years ago, the theory seemed too
&amp;quot;fundamental&amp;quot; and the problems too &amp;quot;similar&amp;quot;. Only now do I appreciate the true
depth that this humble subject has to offer. This is especially true after
solving many beautifully crafted Olympiad problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, now that I have pages filled with diagrams of problems and solutions,
it only worsens my ever-increasing queue of &amp;quot;math to convert to LaTeX&amp;quot;.
Diagrams are also more tedious because it requires additional tools like
Asymptote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, geometry has a new place in my heart. Gone are the days of &lt;em&gt;yet
another find the length problem&lt;/em&gt;. It's a field where more of its magic is
revealed to you the deeper you go. But go too far, and you'll start looking for
concyclic points in stars and raindrops.&lt;code&gt;(sidenote &amp;quot;This is the famous Tetris effect. My record is having diagrams appear in my dream. Besides geometry and Tetris, I've also dreamt of Lisp code.&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much what I've been up to lately. Excuse my bad writing, this is
being written at 4 AM in the morning (revised a day later). ;p&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
