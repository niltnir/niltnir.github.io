and digitally), I present you the &lt;a href=&quot;/math/oly&quot;&gt;Olympiad corner&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you dive in, be sure to read through &lt;a href=&quot;/math#olympiad&quot;&gt;this section&lt;/a&gt; on
my math page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial batch of problems range across the four areas (A, C, N, G) pretty
evenly, with some problems coming from multiple areas. There are twenty-five
problems in total, and the difficulty is on the easier side compared to harder
Olympiads. The selection consists of problems I've solved which I found
interesting, cute, instructional, prototypical, and/or anything in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, the number of problems on this list will grow over time, and as I
gain more experience, the difficulty and diversity will also broaden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I do not have geometry diagrams yet, so you'll have to make do
without them for now... sorry :(&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Math Tech... more like Math TeX!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with &lt;a href=&quot;https://katex.org/&quot;&gt;KaTeX&lt;/a&gt; for math rendering. The syntax
is pretty much the same as LaTeX and it &lt;em&gt;just works&lt;/em&gt;. The nice thing about
KaTeX is that it adheres to the single responsibility principle: it only
renders math. The mess of formatting then becomes the responsibility of the
client.  Although this sounds like a nuisance, on the flip side, it means that
the client gets full control over the page layout. You may miss theorem
numbering and proof environments, but that comes with it the hidden assumption
that the document is static. The dynamic web, however, has a whole host of
tools that allows you to present math in unconventional ways. KaTeX simply
gets out of the way and allows you to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Olympiad solutions, my write-ups are stored and organized using a tool
called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vEnhance/von&quot;&gt;VON&lt;/a&gt;. It maintains modular chunks of
math that I can freely cut and paste wherever I want. This gives me a single
source of truth for any math I write digitally. Want to add a problem to an
article or book? Go to the source and add &lt;code&gt;\voninclude{PROBLEM_SOURCE}&lt;/code&gt;. Want
to retrieve a problem statement for an app or site?  Run a subprocess with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;von show &amp;quot;PROBLEM_SOURCE&amp;quot; -b 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, all I need to do is update VON, and the changes become reflected
everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my build process, I have a simple shell script that pulls Olympiad data
from VON, converts LaTeX to KaTeX readable&lt;label for=&quot;sn-498222-181353&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-498222-181353&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;The syntax that KaTeX expects is a bit different from traditional TeX/LaTeX (no dollar signs, environments wrapped in display mode), but good ol' PCRE's got my back.&lt;/span&gt; form,
and writes the output to temporary files. This is then read by my static site
generator to be integrated with anything added through markdown (including
custom extensions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nice-To-Haves and Things-To-Fix&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the major update, before I forget, I'll mention a few minor things I
want add or fix for the site. This may or may not happen any time soon...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a custom 404 page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fix the URL slugs for the generated Atom feeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the ID/URL generation for image galleries consistent across builds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add syntax highlighting for code blocks?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nano Life Updates/Plans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I decided to order a programmable mechanical keyboard, and
now that I have it, I feel a lot faster compared to when I was only using my
laptop keyboard. This is especially true after having done twenty-five
write-ups.  &lt;label for=&quot;sn-941999-839598&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-941999-839598&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Although this may just be placebo...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides that, for the next few months, I'll probably get back into software. I
have things I want to hack for Zedigo(改). If things go well, maybe an MVP will
be on the horizon?&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Folklore Combinatorics/4</title><id>https://nodalynn.com/folklore-combinatorics4.html</id><author><name></name></author><updated>2024-02-25T04:32:00Z</updated><link href="https://nodalynn.com/folklore-combinatorics4.html" rel="alternate" /><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Maximally Parasocial&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a social gathering of introverts, it was found that for each pair of people,

circumscribed circle, and let \(A_1\), \(B_1\), and \(C_1\) be the midpoints of sides
\(BC\), \(CA\), and \(AB\), respectively. Point \(A_2\) is located on the ray \(OA_1\) so
that \(OAA_1\) is similar to \(OA_2A\). Points \(B_2\) and \(C_2\) on rays \(OB_1\) and
\(OC_1\), respectively, are defined similarly. Prove that lines \(AA_2\), \(BB_2\),
and \(CC_2\) are concurrent, i.e. these three lines intersect at a point.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main claim is that \(AA_2\), \(BB_2\), and \(CC_2\) are the symmedians of
\(\triangle{ABC}\). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WLOG, we show that \(AA_2\) is the \(A\)-symmedian of \(\triangle{ABC}\). By the
symmedian construction, it suffices to prove that \(\angle OBA_2 = 90^\circ =
\angle OCA_2\). The given similar triangles yield \[ OA_1 \cdot OA_2 = OA^2 =
OB^2.\] Then, we have \(OB^2 = OA_1 \cdot OA_2 \iff \frac{OB}{OA_1} = \frac{OA_2}
{OB}\) and \(\angle BOA_1 = \angle BOA_2\). Hence, triangles \(BOA_1\) and \(A_2OB\)
are similar. Since \(OA_1\) is the perpendicular bisector of side \(\overline{BC}\),
\(\angle OBA_2 = 90^\circ\). These arguments can be repeated for \(\angle OCA_2\),
so we get \(\angle OBA_2 = 90^\circ = \angle OCA_2\) as desired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\(BB_2\) and \(CC_2\) are then also symmedians of \(\triangle{ABC}\) and it is well
known that the symmedians of a triangle concur at the Lemoine point.

\cos\), and \( \tan\) buttons, and their inverses (the \( \arcsin\), \( \arccos\), and
\( \arctan\) buttons). The display initially shows \( 0\). Given any positive
rational number \( q\), show that pressing some finite sequence of buttons will
yield the number \( q\) on the display. Assume that the calculator does real
number calculations with infinite precision. All functions are in terms of
radians.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define the set \(\sqrt\mathbb{Q} \coloneqq \{\,q &amp;gt; 0 \mid q^2 \in \mathbb{Q}\, \}
\supset \mathbb{Q}\). Let us then define the functions \(f,g: \sqrt\mathbb{Q}
\to\sqrt\mathbb{Q}\) from the calculator buttons. We have \[f(r)
    \coloneqq \tan\left(\arcsin\left(\cos\left(\arctan r\right)\right)\right) =
    \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \arctan r\right) = \frac{1} {r},\] and \[g(r)
\coloneqq \cos\left(\arctan r\right) = \frac{1} {\sqrt{1 + r^2}}.\] Obviously
\(f\) is bijective because its inverse is defined as itself. On the other hand,
\(g\) is also bijective as its inverse is defined as \(g^{-1}(r) =
\tan\left(\arccos r\right) = \frac{\sqrt{1-r^2}}{r}\) where \(r\) is in the range
of \(g\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose we are given some number \(q\in\sqrt\mathbb{Q}\) to compute. Starting at
\(0\), we can first apply \(\cos\) to get \(1\). We then show that it is possible to
iteratively apply \(f\) and \(g\) a finite number of times to achieve \(q\). Since
\(f\) and \(g\) are bijective, this is equivalent to showing that we can
iteratively apply inverses \(f^{-1}\) and \(g^{-1}\) a finite number of times to
get from \(q\) to \(1\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define a function \(c: \sqrt \mathbb{Q} \to \sqrt \mathbb{Q}\)  as 
\[ c(q) \coloneqq 
\begin{cases}
    f^{-1}(q) = \frac{1}{q} &amp;amp; \text{if } q &amp;gt; 1 \\
    1 &amp;amp; \text{if } q = 1 \\
    g^{-1}(q) = \frac{\sqrt{1-r^2}}{r} &amp;amp; \text{if } 1 &amp;gt; q &amp;gt; 0
\end{cases}. \] We prove that \[
\underbrace{c(c(c(... c}_n(q) ...))) = 1,\] for some positive integer \(n\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Letting \(q = \sqrt\frac{a}{b} = \frac{\sqrt a}{\sqrt b}\), for relatively prime
\(a, b \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\), we get the following cases: If \(a &amp;gt; b\), then \(c(q) =
c\left(\frac{\sqrt a}{\sqrt b}\right) = \frac{\sqrt b} {\sqrt a}\). If \(a=b\),
then \(c(q) = 1\). If \(b &amp;gt; a\), then \[ c(q) = c\left(\frac{\sqrt a}{\sqrt b}
    \right) = \frac{\sqrt{1 - \frac{a}{b}}}{\sqrt\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt {b
- a}}{\sqrt a} .\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't need to consider when \(a = b\), since it clearly satisfies our claim.
Now consider the sum of the squares of the numerator and the denominator when
\(q\) maps to \(c(q)\). For \(q,\) this sum is initially \(a+b\). For \(c(q)\), we either
get \(b+a\) or \(b - a + a = b\). Since \(b + a\), \(b \leq a + b\), notice that every
application of \(c\) monotonically decreases this sum by a positive integer.
It is also impossible to have infinite applications of the first case where
this sum doesn't decrease, so enough applications of \(c\) must bring the sum
down until \(a = b = 1\), at which point we are done.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want nestings of functions to yield rational values, so there are certain
cases that scream \(\textit{don't go there!}\) Expressions like \(\sin \sqrt k\),
\(\cos \sqrt k\), \(\arcsin \frac{m\pi}{n}\), \(\arccos \frac{m\pi} {n}\), etc.  are
such examples. In particular, we don't want ratios of the sides of a traingle
holding factors of \(\pi\). The angle conditions can be a little more relaxed
because we can define the angle whose slope is some rational \(q\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it's rather clear that there will be two kinds of numbers that appear on the
calculator. Those that represent angles and those that represent side ratios.
To get all the rational numbers, we will most likely focus on extracting it
from side ratios. There is also alternation between angle values and ratio
values. Therefore, it's practically impossible to have a repeat of the same
kind of trig function; it must alternate between \(\sin\), \(\cos\), and \(\tan\) to
one of their inverses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can try listing all possible ways of mapping these functions to see what
happens. Begin with some triangle side ratio \(t\) (not necessarily rational).
\(t\) can map to the following:
\[\begin{align*}
    f_1(t) &amp;amp;= \cos\left(\arctan t\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + t^2}} \\
    f_2(t) &amp;amp;= \sin\left(\arctan t\right) = \frac{t}{\sqrt{1 + t^2}} \\
    f_3(t) &amp;amp;= \tan\left(\arcsin t\right) = \frac{t}{\sqrt{1 - t^2}} \\
    f_4(t) &amp;amp;= \tan\left(\arccos t\right) = \frac{\sqrt{1 - t^2}}{t}
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will now try to get all the rationals. Consider what it means for some
rational number \(m\) to be \(\textit{computable}.\) If it were computable, then
persumably, from the above logic, it will come out of one of \(f_1(t)\), \(f_2(t)\),
\(f_3(t)\), or \(f_4(t)\). So let's just see what happens when we let \[ m = f_1(t)
. \]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the relation to hold, we must have
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad m = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + t^2}} \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad m^2\left(1 + t^2\right) = 1 \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad m^2t^2 = 1 - m^2 \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad t^2 = \frac{1 - m^2}{m^2} \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad t = \frac{\sqrt{1 - m^2}}{m},
\end{align*}\]
where each equation above is bidirectional since \(m\), \(t &amp;gt; 0\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if \(m\) is computable, then \(t\) must again be computable from one of \(f_1\),
\(f_2\), \(f_3\), or \(f_4\). We can then try the above method again, reach another
value \(t_1\), and send that back into, say \(f_1\), and so on. Once we hit a value
we know for certain is computable, then we know that unwinding all the
operations should give us a valid way to compute \(m\). This can be seen for the
value \(q = \frac{4}{5}\) below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[q = \frac{4}{5} \ {\color{blue} \to} \ \frac{3}{4} \ {\color{blue} \to} \
\frac{\sqrt 7}{3} \ {\color{blue} \to} \ \frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 7} \
{\color{blue} \to} \ \frac{\sqrt 5}{\sqrt 2} \ {\color{red} \to} \
\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 5} \ {\color{blue} \to} \ \frac{\sqrt 3}{\sqrt 2} \
{\color{red} \to} \ \frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 3} \ {\color{blue} \to} \
\frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \ {\color{blue} \to} \ 1 \ {\to} \ 0\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blue arrows indicate computing \(t\) from \(m\) as above. The red arrows
indicate computing the reciprocal.

guarantee that it is connected?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is \(\tbinom{n-1}{2} + 1 = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1\) edges. We first
show that our answer indeed connects any given graph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider a graph \(G\) that has at least \(\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1\) edges and
assume FTSOC that there exists some \(k\)-vertex subgraph of \(G\) (\(k &amp;lt; n\)), say
\(G_k\), that is disconnected. The degree of each vertex in \(G_k\) must be at most
\(k-1\). Similarly, among the remaining \(n-k\) vertices, since none of them
connect to vertices in \(G_k\), each vertex will have a degree at most \(n-k-1\).
Now if the number of edges in \(G\) is maximized, by the handshake lemma, the
total number of edges in \(G\) must be at most \[ \frac{k(k-1)}{2} + \frac{(n-k)
    (n-k-1)} {2}.\] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, if \(E\) is the total number of edges in \(G\), we must have
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad \frac{k(k-1)}{2} + \frac{(n-k)(n-k-1)}{2} \geq E \geq \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1 \\
    \implies&amp;amp;\quad\frac{k(k-1)}{2} + \frac{(n-k)(n-k-1)}{2} \geq \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1 \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad\frac{n^2-(2k+1)n+2k^2}{2} \geq \frac{n^2-3n+4}{2} \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad k^2 - (k-1)n - 2 \geq 0 \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad k - 2 \geq (k-1)(n-k),
\end{align*}\]
which is a contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It now suffices to show that \(\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1\) is the minimum possible
bound. If the bound is \(\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = \tbinom{n-1}{2}\), then there is a
counterexample of \(G\) as the union of a \(K_{n-1}\) complete graph and one
disconnected vertex. On the other hand, there does exist a graph with
\(\tbinom{n-1}{2} + 1\) edges; \(G\) can be a \(K_{n-1}\) complete graph connected to
a distinct vertex by one edge.

It is possible
to draw the external tangents for each pair of circles so that they intersect at
a point. Prove that these points are collinear.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let the three circles be \(\omega_1\), \(\omega_2\), and \(\omega_3\), and their
centers be \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) respectively. Furthermore, let \(X\) be the
intersection of the tangents between \(\omega_1\), \(\omega_2\), and define \(Y\) and
\(Z\) similarly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WLOG, consider a single external tangent between, say, \(\omega_1\) and
\(\omega_2\). If we let the point of tangency on \(\omega_1\) be \(M\) and the point
of tangency on \(\omega_2\) be \(N\), then clearly, \(M\), \(N\), \(X\) are collinear.
Moreover, \(\measuredangle O_1MX = 90^\circ = \measuredangle O_2NX\), and \(O_1\),
\(O_2\), \(X\) are collinear. Thus, \(\triangle{O_1MX}\) is similar to
\(\triangle{O_2NX}\) with \[ \left|\frac{O_1X}{O_2X}\right| = \left|\frac{O_1M}
{O_2N}\right| = \frac{r_1}{r_2},\] where \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) are the radii of
\(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_2\) respectively. Thus, it also follows that
\(\left|\frac{O_2Y}{O_3Y}\right| =  \frac{r_2}{r_3} \), and \(\left|\frac{O_3Z}
{O_1Z}\right| =  \frac{r_3}{r_1}\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, consider the points \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\). If the points are
collinear, the theorem is obviously true; all the intersections lie on a line.
On the other hand, if the points form a triangle \(\triangle{O_1O_2O_3}\), then we
get a case of Menelaus' Theorem. \[\frac{O_1X}{XO_2}\cdot\frac{O_2Y}{YO_3}
\cdot\frac{O_3Z}{ZO_1} = \left(-\frac{r_1}{r_2}\right)\left(-\frac{r_2}
{r_3}\right)\left(-\frac{r_3}{r_1}\right) = -1,\]
where the length ratios are directed.

and \(\omega\) be the circle with center \(O\) described in the problem statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\(M\), \(P\), and \(Q\) are then collinear by the so called \(\textit{shooting lemma}\),
which we prove as follows. It is clear that there exists a homothety mapping
\(\omega\) to \(\Gamma\), since \(O_\Gamma\), \(O\), and \(Q\) are collinear, \(MO_{\Gamma}
\) is parallel to \(PO\) (both perpendicular to \(\overline{BC})\), and both
\(\triangle{MO_{\Gamma}Q}\) and \(\triangle{POQ}\) are isosceles. Consequently, \(M\),
\(P\), and \(Q\) are collinear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now claim that \(M\), \(O_{\Gamma}\), \(N\) are also collinear. We have \[
\measuredangle CBN = \measuredangle CAN = \measuredangle CAO = \measuredangle
OAB = \measuredangle NAB = \measuredangle NCB, \] so \(N\) must be the midpoint of
arc \(\widehat{BC}\) not containing \(A\). Thus, \(MN\) is simply the diameter of
\(\Gamma\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now use the above to show that \(A\), \(P\), \(O\), \(Q\) are concyclic. Using the
homothety defined above, we see that \[ \measuredangle OPQ = \measuredangle
O_{\Gamma}MQ = \measuredangle NMQ = \measuredangle NAQ = \measuredangle OAQ, \]
so \(A\), \(P\), \(O\), \(Q\) are concyclic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, since \(\triangle{OPQ}\) is isosceles, \[ \measuredangle QAO =
\measuredangle QPO = \measuredangle OQP = \measuredangle OAP.  \]

that \(A\), \(P\), \(O\), and \(Q\) are concyclic. This requires discovering point \(N\)

positive integers such that \(p &amp;lt; q \leq n\) and \(p + q &amp;gt; n\). If \(\mathcal{R}
_n\) is the set of all ordered pairs \((p, q)\), prove that \[\sum_{(p,q) \in
\mathcal{R}_n} \frac{1}{pq} = \frac{1}{2}.\]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a set of positive integer pairs \(X = \{\left(a_1, b_1\right), \left(a_2,
b_2\right), \dots, \left(a_n, b_n\right)\}\), define the function \(\sigma:X\to
\mathbb{Q}\) as \[ \sigma(X) \coloneqq \sum_{(a,b) \in X}\frac{1}{ab}.\]
Moreover, define the sets \(A_n \coloneqq \{(p,q)\in \mathcal{R}_n \mid p+q&amp;gt;n+1\}
\), \(B_n \coloneqq \{(p,q) \in \mathcal{R}_n \mid p+q=n+1\}\), and \(N_n \coloneqq
\{(p, n) \in \mathcal{R}_n\} \). We derive a few properties of these sets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By construction, \(A_n\) and \(B_n\) are disjoint sets such that \(A_n \cup B_n =
\mathcal{R}_n\) (ie.  \(A_n = \mathcal{R}_n \setminus B_n\)). Furthermore, since
the sum of each pair in \(A_n\) is greater than \(n+1\) and follow the conditions
satisfied by \(\mathcal{R}_n\), the pairs appear in the set \(\mathcal{R}_{n+1}\).
In other words, \(A_n \subset \mathcal{R}_{n+1}\). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\(N_n\) is also the complement of \(A_{n-1}\) with respect to \(\mathcal{R}_{n}\).
\(A_{n-1} \subset \mathcal{R}_n\) from before, and each element of \(A_{n-1}\) is a
pair whose greatest element is at most \(n-1\). Likewise, \(N_n \subset \mathcal{R}
_n\), but each element of \(N_n\) is a pair whose greatest element is exectly \(n\).
These sets therefore disjointly make up \(\mathcal{R}_n\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have shown that \(A_n \sqcup B_n = \mathcal{R}_n = A_{n-1} \sqcup N_n\), so it
is clear that \[\sigma(A_n) + \sigma(B_n) = \sigma(\mathcal{R}_n) =
\sigma(A_{n-1}) + \sigma(N_n)\] for each \(n &amp;gt; 2\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then proceed to prove by induction that \(\sigma(\mathcal{R}_n) = \frac{1} {2}
\) for each \(n &amp;gt; 2\) (\(n=2\) is trivially true). The base case is \(n=3\), for which
\(\mathcal{R}_3 = \{(1,3), (2,3)\}\), and \(\sigma(\mathcal{R} _3) = \frac{1} {3}
+ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\). Now suppose that for some integer \(k &amp;gt; 2\),
\(\sigma(\mathcal{R}_k)=\frac{1}{2}\). By the equalities derived above, we have
\[\begin{align*}
    \sigma(\mathcal{R}_{k+1}) &amp;amp;= \sigma(A_k) + \sigma(N_{k+1}) \\
               &amp;amp;= \sigma(\mathcal{R}_k) - \sigma(B_k) + \sigma(N_{k+1}) \\
               &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2} + \sigma(N_{k+1}) - \sigma(B_k).
\end{align*}\]
Thus, it suffices to show that \(\sigma(N_{k+1}) = \sigma(B_k)\) for each \(k&amp;gt;2\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now prove a short lemma. For positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) such that
\(a+b=m\), \(a\perp m \iff a\perp b \iff b\perp m\). By symmetry, it suffices to
prove that \(a\perp m\) if and only if \(a\perp b\). The Euclidean algorithm yields
\(\gcd(m, a) = \gcd(a, m - a = b)\), so if one of them is \(1\) then so is the
other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let us now compute \(\sigma(N_{k+1})\). We have 
\[\begin{align*}
\sigma(N_{k+1}) &amp;amp;= \sum_{\substack{0&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;k+1\\ p\perp k+1}} \frac{1}{p(k+1)} \\
           &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2}\cdot\sum_{\substack{0&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;k+1\\ p\perp k+1}}\left(\frac{1}{p(k+1)}+\frac{1}{(k+1-p)(k+1)}\right) \\
           &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2}\cdot\sum_{\substack{0&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;k+1\\ p\perp k+1}}\frac{1}{p(k+1-p)} \\
           &amp;amp;= \sum_{\substack{0&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;q\leq k\\ p+q=k+1\\ p\perp q}}\frac{1}{pq} \\
           &amp;amp;= \sum_{\substack{(p,q)\in \mathcal{R}_k\\ p+q=k+1}}\frac{1}{pq} = \sigma(B_k),
\end{align*}\]
where our lemma is used on the second and the fourth equalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have shown that \(\sigma(N_{k+1})=\sigma(B_k)\) for each \(k&amp;gt;2\), completing the
proof.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main difficulty of this problem is to get the whole induction to go
through.  We want to somehow link the \(n=k\) case to the \(n=k+1\) case, but
simple computations of the sum do not yield anything fruitful. This motivates
us to analyze the actual pairs instead. We see that some of the pairs appear
multiple times across \(n\), so we question whether we have anything useful to
say about them. One of the key realizations is to notice that if pair \((p, q)
\in \mathcal{R}_k\) has the property \(p+q&amp;gt;k+1\), then that pair carries over to
the next sum for \(n=k+1\).  It is then easy to realize that the rest of the
pairs that make up \(\mathcal{R}_{k+1}\) have largest element \(k+1\). This
motivates the three sets we defined in the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, the rest of the problem simplifies to showing that the sums from
these sets are equal. The insight here is that numbers relatively prime to some
integer \(k\) come in pairs that sum to \(k\). This is the lemma we proved in the
solution.

horizontally or vertically. In order to open it, all the keys must be vertically
oriented. When a key is switched to another position, all the other keys in the
same row and column automatically switch their positions too. Show
that no matter what the starting positions are, it is always possible to open
this lock. (Only one key can be switched at a time.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It suffices to show that there exists a sequence of moves such that any of the
keys can be switched individually without altering the rest of the
configuration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select any key to individually switch and call this the \(\textit{main}\) key.
Now consider all the keys that occupy the same row or the same column as this
key. Together, there are \(7\) such keys including the main key. We claim that
our sequence of moves consists of switching each of these keys once regardless
of order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prove that this works, we count the number of times each key gets switched.
There are three cases to consider: the main key, the \(6\) other keys to switch,
and the rest of the keys left untouched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the main key, the position changes each time we switch one of the \(7\) keys.
Since \(7\) is odd, by the end of the operation, it will switch to a different
position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, for the other \(6\) keys, a key either shares the same row or the same
column as the main key. WLOG, if the key shares the same row with the main key,
then when the \(7\) keys get switched, only the keys in the same row affect our
key. Hence, any such key gets switched \(4\) times, returning them to their
original positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, for the untouched keys, a key will share the same row with one of the
\(6\) keys, and share the same column with another of the \(6\) keys. This means
that untouched keys are switched a total of \(2\) times, so they too will switch
back to their original positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have shown that only the main key gets switched to a different position
after the sequence of moves, so we are done.

subsets \(\{\emptyset, \{1\}\}\), so \(a_1=2\) and when \(n=2\), we have the subsets
\(\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}\}\), so \(a_2=3\). It now suffices to prove that \(a_n = a_{n-1} +
a_{n-2}\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the numbers \(1\), \(2\), \(\dots\), \(n\). We do casework on whether to
include or exclude \(n\) in our subset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose we include \(n\). This means that we cannot include \(n - 1\). The
exclusion of \(n-1\) does not affect the inclusion of the rest of the numbers
between \(1\) and \(n-2\), so there will be \(a_{n-2}\) subsets that can be formed
with these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if we exclude \(n\), then this does not affect the inclusion of
the rest of the numbers from \(1\) to \(n-1\). Therefore, there will be \(a_{n-1}\)
subsets that can be formed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have therefore shown that \(a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\), so \(a_{n} = F_{n+2}\).

adjacent vertices have different colors. Let \(B\) be the sum of the black

start with \(B=1\) and \(W=0\). An update to an edge increases each of \(B\) and \(W\)
by \(1,\) so their difference is invariant (ie. \(B - W = 1\)). The desired end

there are \(n\) odd positive integers, clearly there will be \(n\) partitions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now claim that any two numbers in the same partition have the property that
one divides the other. Suppose WLOG that positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) have the

sequence where each term in the original sequence is replaced by the arithmetic
mean of the term and the next term after it (where the last term is paired 
with the first term). If we start with a sequence of integers where no two
terms are equal, then prove that iteratively taking the mean-map of the
seqeunce will eventually produce non-integral terms.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will first prove the following assertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If \(q_1\), \(q_2\), \(\dots\), \(q_n\) \((n &amp;gt; 2)\) is a seqeunce of pairwise distinct
integers, then no matter how many times the mean-map is taken, a seqeuence will
never have all equal terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assume FTSOC that at some point all the terms become equal. Suppose the
sequence \(r_1\), \(r_2\), \(\dots\), \(r_n\) of integers are not all equal and the map
\[ \left(r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n\right) \mapsto \left(\frac{r_1+r_2} {2},
        \frac{r_2+r_3} {2}, \dots, \frac{r_n+r_1} {2}\right) \] yields
        \[\frac{r_1+r_2}{2} = \frac{r_2+r_3}{2} = \dots = \frac{r_n+r_1}{2}
        \iff r_1+r_2 = r_2+r_3 = \dots = r_n+r_1.\] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If \(n\) is odd, then we derive that \(r_1 = r_2 = \dots = r_n\), contradicting the
fact that they are not all equal. It suffices to then consider the case when
\(n\) is even.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If \(n\) is even, the above equality yields \(r_1 = r_3 = \dots = r_{n-1}\) and
\(r_2 = r_4 = \dots = r_n\). Suppose that \(x = r_1\) and \(y = r_2\). If \(x=y\), then
we get a contradiction as in the odd case, so consider \(x\neq y\). It suffices
to show that there cannot exist a sequence of integers \(s_1\), \(s_2\), \(\dots\),
\(s_n\) such that \[ \left(s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n\right) \mapsto \left(x, y, \dots,
x, y\right).\] If such a sequence exists, then \(s_1 + s_2 = s_3 + s_4 = \dots =
s_{n-1} + s_n = 2x\) and \(s_2 + s_3 = s_4 + s_5 = \dots = s_n + s_1 = 2y\). From
which it follows that \(\sum_{i=1}^n s_i = nx\) and \(\sum_{i=1}^n s_i = ny\)
respectively. However, since \(x \neq y\), this is clearly a contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we show that the sum of the pairwise distances between terms always
decreases. Let \(D_k\) be the sum after taking \(k\) mean-maps, we have
\[\begin{align*}
D_k &amp;amp;= \sum_{1\leq i\leq j\leq n} \left| q_i - q_j \right|\\
      &amp;amp;= 2\sum_{1\leq i\leq j\leq n} \frac{\left| q_i - q_j \right|}{2} \\
      &amp;amp;= \sum_{1\leq i\leq j\leq n} \frac{\left| q_i - q_j \right| + \left| q_{i+1} - q_{j+1} \right|}{2} \\
      &amp;amp;&amp;gt; \sum_{1\leq i\leq j\leq n} \left|\frac{q_i + q_{i+1}}{2} - \frac{q_j + q_{j+1}}{2}\right| \\
      &amp;amp;= D_{k+1},

where indicies are taken cyclically modulo \(n\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since \(D_k \geq 0\) always decreases after taking a mean-map and the terms never
equate to one another (\(D_k \neq 0\) for each \(k\)), eventually \(D_k\) will stop
decreasing by integers, at which point it will decrease by a non-integer. The
distance between terms will then be non-integral, so some term must become
non-integral.

with the monovariant \(D_k\): the sum of the pairwise distances between terms.
Enough experimentation should reveal that the terms seem to &amp;quot;converge&amp;quot;
together after enough mean-maps. This then motivates the next key insight which
is to question whether all the terms become equal. This is important because
the equality case is a fixed point under a mean-map. To guarantee that we
always get non-integral terms, we must eliminate the potentially unwieldly
cases where the configurations somehow jumps to this fixed point. Once these
two insights are found however, the rest are minor details.

Let
\(H\) be the orthocentre, that is the point where the altitudes meet. Prove that
\[\frac{AB\cdot AC + BC\cdot BA + CA\cdot CB}{AH\cdot AD + BH\cdot BE + CH\cdot

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should come back to clean up this solution because it's embarrassingly
long... But nonetheless, here is &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; solution:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) denote the lengths of the sides \(BC\), \(AC\), and \(AB\)
respectively. We begin with an obvious statement of AM-GM:
\[ab + bc + ca \leq a^2 + b^2 + c^2\] is equivalent to
\[\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} 
    &amp;amp;\leq \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{abc} \\
    &amp;amp;= \frac{\left(c^2 + b^2 - a^2\right) + \left(a^2 + c^2 - b^2\right) + \left(a^2 + b^2 - c^2\right)}{abc} \\
    &amp;amp;= 2\left(\frac{\cos A}{a} + \frac{\cos B}{b} + \frac{\cos C}{c}\right).
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now suppose \(x = c\cdot AF\), \(y = a\cdot BD\), and \(z = b\cdot CE\). We claim that
\[\begin{align*} 
    x\cos B\cos C &amp;amp;= \frac{xyz}{a^2bc},\\ 
    y\cos C\cos A &amp;amp;= \frac{xyz}{ab^2c}, \\
    z\cos A\cos B &amp;amp;= \frac{xyz}{abc^2}.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the symmetry of the configuration, WLOG it suffices to show that \(x\cos B\cos
C = \frac{xyz}{a^2bc}\). We have
\[\begin{align*}
    x\cos B\cos C 
    &amp;amp;= c\cdot AF\cdot\cos B\cos C \\
    &amp;amp;= (c\cos B)\cdot AF\cdot\cos C \\
    &amp;amp;= BD\cdot AF\cdot \frac{CE}{a} \\
    &amp;amp;= \frac{xyz}{a^2bc}.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiplying both sides of our derived inequality by \(\frac{xyz}{abc}\), we get 
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad \sum_{cyc}\frac{xyz}{a^2bc} \leq 2\sum_{cyc}\left(\frac{xyz}{a^2bc}\cos A\right)\\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad \sum_{cyc}x\cos B\cos C \leq 2(x+y+z)\cos A\cos B\cos C\\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad \frac{x}{\cos A} + \frac{y}{\cos B} + \frac{z}{\cos C} \leq 2(x+y+z),
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;where the cyclic sum is taken across the triplet \((a\), \(b\), \(c)\), the triplet
\((x\), \(y\), \(z)\), and the triplet \((A\), \(B\), \(C)\). Also note that \(0 &amp;lt; \cos A\),
\(\cos B\), \(\cos C &amp;lt; 1\) since \(ABC\) is acute. Now observe that \[ \frac{x}
{\cos A} = \frac{c\cdot AF}{\cos A} = \frac{c\cdot AF\cdot b}{AF} = bc,\] as
well as \(\frac{y}{\cos B}=ab\) and \(\frac{z}{\cos C} = ca\). Furthermore, it is
well known that the points \(F\), \(B\), \(D\), \(H\), the points \(H\), \(D\), \(C\), \(E\),
and the points \(E\), \(A\), \(F\), \(H\) are respectively concyclic, so by the power
of a point, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[\begin{align*}
    x &amp;amp;= c\cdot AF = AH\cdot AD, \\
    y &amp;amp;= a\cdot BD = BH\cdot BE, \\
    z &amp;amp;= b\cdot CE = CH\cdot CF.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substituting for the inequality above gives us \[ \frac{AB\cdot AC + BC\cdot BA
+ CA\cdot CB}{AH\cdot AD + BH\cdot BE + CH\cdot CF} \leq 2.\]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motivation for the solution is to think about how to interpret each product
that appears in the expression on the left-hand side. Initially, the products
\(AB\cdot AC\), \(BC\cdot BA\), and \(CA\cdot CB\) motivate us to think about area,
but this line of thought is shot down by the fact that \(\sin\) doesn't give us
the lengths we care about. The lengths we care about are the ones that appear
in the problem statement as well as the ones that can be derived from power of
a point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this train of thought however, one might reach the critical insight, which
is that \[AB\cdot AC\cdot\cos A = AB\cdot AC\cdot \frac{AE}{AB} = AE\cdot AC =
AH\cdot AD,\] where the same relation holds for the other angles. A natural
train of thought is: if \(\sin\) didn't work, why not \(\cos\)? Or one can realize
that \(AE\) is the projection of \(AB\) onto side \(AC\). Or instead of thinking
about areas, think about dot products. Any one of these should lead to this key
insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From here, the problem becomes substantially easier, so the rest is mostly
algebraic and geometric grunt work.

Let the angle bisector of \(\angle AXD\) intersect \(AD\), \(BC\), at \(E\), \(F\)
respectively and let the angle bisector of \(\angle AYB\) intersect \(AB\), \(CD\) at
\(G\), \(H\) respectively. Prove that \(EFGH\) is a parallelogram.

then compute the value of \(\angle XZY\):
\[\begin{align*}
    \angle XZY &amp;amp;= \angle EZY \\
               &amp;amp;= 180^\circ - (\angle EYZ + \angle ZEY) \\

               &amp;amp;= 180^\circ - (\angle DYH + \angle FXB + \angle DCB) \\
               &amp;amp;= 180^\circ - \left[\frac{1}{2}\left(\widehat{CD} - \widehat{AB}\right) + \left(\widehat{BC} - \widehat{DA}\right) + \angle DCB\right] \\
               &amp;amp;= 180^\circ - \left(\frac{1}{2}\widehat{BCD} - \frac{1}{2}\widehat{DAB} + \angle DCB \right) \\
               &amp;amp;= 180^\circ - \left(\frac{1}{2}\angle BAD - \frac{1}{2}\angle DCB + \angle DCB \right) \\
               &amp;amp;= 180^\circ - \frac{1}{2}\left(\angle BAD + \angle DCB \right) \\
               &amp;amp;= 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus we deduce that \(XZ\) is perpendicular to \(YZ\). Now consider \(\triangle{HXG}\)
and \(\triangle{EYF}\). Segments \(\overline{XZ}\) and \(\overline{YZ}\) are each both
an angle bisector and an altitude of \(\triangle{HXG}\) and \(\triangle{EYF}\)
respectively. It follows that the triangles are both isosceles, and in
particular, \(XZ\) bisects \(\overline{HG}\) and \(YZ\) bisects \(\overline{EF}\). \(E\)
and \(F\) are on \(XZ\), and \(G\) and \(H\) are on \(YZ\) respectively, so the result has
been proven.

Find all functions \(f\), defined on \(\mathbb{N}\) and taking values in \(\mathbb{N}
\), such that \((n-1)^2 &amp;lt; f(n)f(f(n)) &amp;lt; n^2 + n\) for every positive integer \(n\).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We claim that the only solution to \(f\) is \(f(n)=n\). Clearly, the inequality \[\
    (n-1)^2 &amp;lt; f(n)f(f(n)) = nf(n) = n^2 &amp;lt; n^2 + n
\] holds. We then show that \(f(n) = n\) for each \(n \in \mathbb{N}\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin, we prove by induction that \(f(n)\geq n\) for each \(n \in \mathbb{N}\).
The base case is \(n = 1\), where in which \(0 &amp;lt; f(1)f(f(1)) &amp;lt; 2\). This implies
that \(f(1) = 1\). Now suppose that \(f(k)\geq k\) for each \(1 \leq k \leq n - 1\),
and assume FTSOC that \(f(n) &amp;lt; n\). Since \(f(n)\) is in \(\mathbb{N}\), we know that 
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad f(n) &amp;lt; n \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad f(n) \leq n - 1 \\
    \implies&amp;amp;\quad f(n)^2 \leq (n-1)^2 &amp;lt; f(n)f(f(n)) \\
    \implies&amp;amp;\quad f(n) &amp;lt; f(f(n)).
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However note that because \(1 \leq f(n) \leq n-1\), by the hypothesis, \(f(f(n))
\geq f(n)\). This is a contradiction, so \(f(n) \geq n\) completes the induction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then show that \(f(n) \not&amp;gt; n\) for each \(n \in \mathbb{N}\). Suppose that \(f(n) &amp;gt;
n\). We then have
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad f(n) &amp;gt; n \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad f(n) \geq n + 1 \\
    \implies&amp;amp;\quad f(n)^2 \geq (n+1)^2 &amp;gt; n^2+n &amp;gt; f(n)f(f(n)) \\
    \implies&amp;amp;\quad f(n) &amp;gt; f(f(n)).
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But clearly, by the fact that \(f(n) \geq n\) for each \(n\), it must be that
\(f(f(n)) \geq f(n)\). This is a contradiction, so \(f(n) \not&amp;gt; n\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we have shown that \(f(n) = n\) for each \(n\), so the only function
\(f:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) must be \(f(n)=n\).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a typical garden-variety functional \(\sout{\text{equation}}\) inequality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observing that \(f\) is defined in \(\mathbb{N}\), we are motivated to test small
values of \(n\). At first, the experimentation will make the problem smell like
number theory, but after a while, we observe a recursive structure in the
bounds. From here, we guess that the answer is just \(n\), and the usage of
strong induction is highly motivated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only point of caution is to not get \(\textit{for each}\) mixed up with
\(\textit{for some}\).  This is the infamous point-wise trap. When we say that
\(f(n) \geq n\), we must specify whether this is true for some particular value
of \(n\), or for each \(n \in \mathbb{N}\). The distinction seems subtle, but the
consequences are dire.  For example, if \(f(n) \geq n\) is for true for each \(n\),
then we can safely conclude that \(f(f(n)) \geq f(n)\), whereas if the argument
is only true for some \(n\), we cannot make such conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are lines of logic that are even more seemingly subtle than what
is described above. The famous one is the distinction between \(\textit{for each}
\) and \(\textit{for all}\). Intuitively, they seem interchangeable (\(\forall\)),
but they can mean completely different things depending on the context. In
these cases, leaning towards for each is a good bet.

Show
that the sum \[\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{a_i}{\prod_{j=1}^i (1+a_j)}\] is greater than
or equal to \(\frac{2^n - 1}{2^n}\).

\[\begin{align*}

        &amp;amp;= a_1 + a_1a_2 + a_2 \\
        &amp;amp;= (1 + a_1)(1 + a_2) - 1 \\
        &amp;amp;= P_2 - 1.
\end{align*}\]
Now suppose that the claim is true for \(n=k\).
\[\begin{align*}
    S_{k+1} &amp;amp;= (1 + a_{k+1})(P_k - 1) + a_{k+1} \\
          &amp;amp;= (1 + a_{k+1})P_k - 1 - a_{k+1} + a_{k+1} \\
          &amp;amp;= P_{k+1} - 1,
\end{align*}\]
completes the induction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expression in the problem statement can be rewritten as \(\frac{S_n}{P_n}\).
Since \(a_1a_2\dots a_n = 1\), by the AM-GM inequality, \[ P_n = \prod_{i=1}
^n(1+a_i) \geq 2^n\sqrt{a_1a_2\dots a_n} = 2^n.\] Therefore,
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad\frac{1}{2^n} \geq \frac{1}{P_n} \\

x_2 &amp;lt; \dots &amp;lt; x_{n-1}\); (b) \(x_i + x_{n-i} = 2n\) for all \(i = 1, 2, \dots, n-1\);
(c) given any two indices \(i\) and \(j\) (not necessarily distinct) for which \(x_i

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We claim that the answer is only the sequence \(2, 4, 6, \dots, 2n - 2\). It is
easy to verify that all of the conditions are met. (a) and (b) are trivial. To
verify (c), note that if we divide each of the terms by \(2\), the resulting
sequence is simply the sequence of integers from \(1\) to \(n-1\). Since \(x_i + x_j
&amp;lt; 2n\) is equivalent to \(\frac{x_i}{2} + \frac{x_j}{2} &amp;lt; n\), we know that there
exists some index \(k\) for which \(\frac{x_i}{2} + \frac{x_j}{2} = \frac{x_k}{2}\),
where \(\frac{x_k}{2}\) is one of the integers between \(1\) and \(n-1\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then show that this is the only sequence that works. We claim that
\[\begin{align*} 
    x_1 + x_{n-2} &amp;amp;= x_{n-1} \\
    x_1 + x_{n-3} &amp;amp;= x_{n-2} \\
                  &amp;amp;\vdots \\
    x_1 + x_2 &amp;amp;= x_3.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin, note that \[x_1 &amp;lt; x_2 \iff x_1 + 2n - x_2 &amp;lt; 2n \iff x_1 + x_{n-2} &amp;lt;
2n. \] By condition (c), there exists some term whose sum is \(x_1 + x_{n-2}\).
Since \(x_1 + x_{n-2} &amp;gt; x_{n-2},\) the only possibility is \(x_{n-1}\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, observe that \(x_{n-3} &amp;lt; x_1 + x_{n-3} &amp;lt; x_1 + x_{n-2} = x_{n-1} &amp;lt; 2n\) so
it follows that \(x_1 + x_{n-3} = x_{n-2}\). Repeating the logic \(n-3\) more times,
we discover that the system of equations in the claim holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now show that \(x_2 = 2x_1\). We have
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad x_1 + x_{n-2} = x_{n-1} \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad x_1 + 2n - x_2 = 2n - x_1 \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad x_2 = 2x_1.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substituting the above into our equations and iteratively substituting
thereafter, we find that \(x_2 = 2x_1\), \(x_3 = 3x_1\), \(\dots\), \(x_{n-2} = (n-2)x_1\),
and \(x_{n-1} = (n-1)x_1\). Since \(2n - x_1 = x_{n-1} = (n-1)x_1\), we derive that
\(x_1 = 2\). Therefore the only sequence is \(2, 4, 6, \dots, 2n-2\).

&amp;lt; n - 1\), the rest of the solution becomes details. The motivation for the key
claim is to realize that the sum with the maximal gap between terms is
extremely (no pun intended) well-defined. Then, it's easy to \(\textit{tip}\) the
dominoe to get all the other equalities. This is a nice problem where analyzing

\(p^2+2p=p(p+2)\), where both \(p\) and \(p+2\) are within the range of \(t\). In other
words, there must exist multiples of \(p\) and \(p+2\) among the \(2p-1\) consecutive
integers that produce \(C\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, we conclude that \[L(n,k) = pC = pL(n+1,k) &amp;gt; bL(n+1, k).\]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motivation for the solution is to notice that \(L(n,k)\) and \(L(n + 1, k)\)
doesn't change &amp;quot;by much&amp;quot;. This is in the sense that the least common multiples
that these expressions are evaluating basically the same thing except the first
or last term in a sequence of consecutive integers. This motivates us to
invent \(C\), the least common multiple of the &amp;quot;common&amp;quot; numbers between each
sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the solution stems from trying to control the behavior of \(C\) to not
take too many or too few factors given arbitrary \(n\) and \(k\). This is a
construction problem, so once an example is found, we're done.
