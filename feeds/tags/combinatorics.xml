exactly one of them knew the other. Prove that there was someone in the
gathering that each person either knew or knew someone else who did.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call the person that was known to the most number of people \(A\). We claim that
person \(A\) is the one with the desired properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose the number of people who knew \(A\) was \(k\). If \(A\) did not know anyone
in the gathering, then everyone must have known \(A\) so our work is done.
Otherwise, \(A\) must have known someone else, say person \(B\). It then suffices
to show that \(B\) knew someone that knew \(A\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If \(B\) did not know anyone else who knew \(A\), then clearly, \(B\) must not have
known the \(k\) people who knew \(A\). Thus, \(B\) must have been known to the \(k\)
people who knew \(A\). And since \(A\) knew \(B\), in total, \(B\) must have been known
by \(k+1\) people. This contradicts the maximality of the number of people who
knew \(A\), so our assumption that \(B\) did not know anyone who knew \(A\)
is false. \(B\) must have known someone who knew \(A\).

construction through the extremal principle. We hypothesize that the desired
object maximizes some function, and if said hypothesis is in fact true, the
solution should come out via assuming falsity and arriving at some
contradiction.

guarantee that it is connected?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is \(\tbinom{n-1}{2} + 1 = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1\) edges. We first
show that our answer indeed connects any given graph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider a graph \(G\) that has at least \(\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1\) edges and
assume FTSOC that there exists some \(k\)-vertex subgraph of \(G\) (\(k &amp;lt; n\)), say
\(G_k\), that is disconnected. The degree of each vertex in \(G_k\) must be at most
\(k-1\). Similarly, among the remaining \(n-k\) vertices, since none of them
connect to vertices in \(G_k\), each vertex will have a degree at most \(n-k-1\).
Now if the number of edges in \(G\) is maximized, by the handshake lemma, the
total number of edges in \(G\) must be at most \[ \frac{k(k-1)}{2} + \frac{(n-k)
    (n-k-1)} {2}.\] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, if \(E\) is the total number of edges in \(G\), we must have
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad \frac{k(k-1)}{2} + \frac{(n-k)(n-k-1)}{2} \geq E \geq \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1 \\
    \implies&amp;amp;\quad\frac{k(k-1)}{2} + \frac{(n-k)(n-k-1)}{2} \geq \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1 \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad\frac{n^2-(2k+1)n+2k^2}{2} \geq \frac{n^2-3n+4}{2} \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad k^2 - (k-1)n - 2 \geq 0 \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad k - 2 \geq (k-1)(n-k),
\end{align*}\]
which is a contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It now suffices to show that \(\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1\) is the minimum possible
bound. If the bound is \(\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = \tbinom{n-1}{2}\), then there is a
counterexample of \(G\) as the union of a \(K_{n-1}\) complete graph and one
disconnected vertex. On the other hand, there does exist a graph with
\(\tbinom{n-1}{2} + 1\) edges; \(G\) can be a \(K_{n-1}\) complete graph connected to
a distinct vertex by one edge.

horizontally or vertically. In order to open it, all the keys must be vertically
oriented. When a key is switched to another position, all the other keys in the
same row and column automatically switch their positions too. Show
that no matter what the starting positions are, it is always possible to open
this lock. (Only one key can be switched at a time.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It suffices to show that there exists a sequence of moves such that any of the
keys can be switched individually without altering the rest of the
configuration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select any key to individually switch and call this the \(\textit{main}\) key.
Now consider all the keys that occupy the same row or the same column as this
key. Together, there are \(7\) such keys including the main key. We claim that
our sequence of moves consists of switching each of these keys once regardless
of order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prove that this works, we count the number of times each key gets switched.
There are three cases to consider: the main key, the \(6\) other keys to switch,
and the rest of the keys left untouched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the main key, the position changes each time we switch one of the \(7\) keys.
Since \(7\) is odd, by the end of the operation, it will switch to a different
position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, for the other \(6\) keys, a key either shares the same row or the same
column as the main key. WLOG, if the key shares the same row with the main key,
then when the \(7\) keys get switched, only the keys in the same row affect our
key. Hence, any such key gets switched \(4\) times, returning them to their
original positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, for the untouched keys, a key will share the same row with one of the
\(6\) keys, and share the same column with another of the \(6\) keys. This means
that untouched keys are switched a total of \(2\) times, so they too will switch
back to their original positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have shown that only the main key gets switched to a different position
after the sequence of moves, so we are done.

hand, when the array has odd dimensions, there seem to be certain invariants
preventing potential solutions. I haven't investigated the problem enough, so I
can't say for sure.

adjacent numbers?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let \(a_n\) be the number of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \dots, n\}\) that do not contain
adjacent numbers. We claim that \(a_n = F_{n+2}\), where \(F_n\) denotes the \(n\)-th
Fibonacci number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, let us compute the first two values of \((a_n)\). When \(n=1\), we have the
subsets \(\{\emptyset, \{1\}\}\), so \(a_1=2\) and when \(n=2\), we have the subsets
\(\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}\}\), so \(a_2=3\). It now suffices to prove that \(a_n = a_{n-1} +
a_{n-2}\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the numbers \(1\), \(2\), \(\dots\), \(n\). We do casework on whether to
include or exclude \(n\) in our subset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose we include \(n\). This means that we cannot include \(n - 1\). The
exclusion of \(n-1\) does not affect the inclusion of the rest of the numbers
between \(1\) and \(n-2\), so there will be \(a_{n-2}\) subsets that can be formed
with these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if we exclude \(n\), then this does not affect the inclusion of
the rest of the numbers from \(1\) to \(n-1\). Therefore, there will be \(a_{n-1}\)
subsets that can be formed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have therefore shown that \(a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\), so \(a_{n} = F_{n+2}\).
Our particular problem asks for the case when \(n = 100\), so \[a_{100} = F_{102}
= \boxed{927,372,692,193,078,999,176}.\]

labeled with a \(1\). An operation consists of choosing an edge of the cube and
incrementing the numbers at the endpoints by \(1\). Can all the numbers be (i)
equal, or (ii) divisible by 3 after a finite number of these operations?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;(i) is impossible for parity reasons. Updating an edge increases the total sum
of the vertices by \(2\), the initial configuration starts with an odd sum, and
the the sum of the vertices in the desired configuration is even (\(8k\) where
\(k\) is the quantity on each vertex).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ii) is more interesting. Suppose we two-color the vertices of the cube, that
is, color the vertices with two colors, say black and white, in such a way that
adjacent vertices have different colors. Let \(B\) be the sum of the black
vertices and \(W\) be the sum of the white vertices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WLOG, assume that the \(1\) in the initial configuration is on a black vertex. We
start with \(B=1\) and \(W=0\). An update to an edge increases each of \(B\) and \(W\)
by \(1,\) so their difference is invariant (ie. \(B - W = 1\)). The desired end
state where each of the \(8\) numbers is divisible by \(3\) requires \(B - W\) to be
divisible by \(3\) so the desired goal is impossible.

two conditions but not necessarily the third. Furthermore, define a
\(\textit{cyclic shift}\) of a \(\textit{p}\)-tuple \(\left(a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_p\right)\) as the tuple obtained from adding a constant \(k \left(0 \leq k \leq
p - 1\right)\) to each element and taking the values modulo \(p\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, for any given close \(\textit{p}\)-tuple, there exists \(p\) cyclic
shifts. We then claim that exactly one of these cyclic shifts is good. If we
let \(A_0 = \left(a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_p\right)\) and \(A_k = \left(a_1 + k,
    a_2 + k, a_3 + k, \dots, a_p + k\right)\), then note that \[ \sum_{i=1}
    ^p\left(a_i + k\right) = pk + \sum_{i=1}^p a_i \equiv \sum_{i=1}^p a_i
\not\equiv 0 \pmod{p}, \] and
\[\begin{align*} \sum_{i=1}^p\left(a_i + k\right)\left(a_{i+1}+k\right) 
    &amp;amp;=\sum_{i=1}^p\left(a_ia_{i+1} + ka_i + ka_{i+1} + k^2\right) \\ 
    &amp;amp;= pk^2 + 2k\sum_{i=1}^p a_i + \sum_{i=1}^p a_ia_{i+1}  \\
    &amp;amp;\equiv 2k\sum_{i=1}^p a_i + \sum_{i=1}^p a_ia_{i+1}, 
\end{align*}\] 
where indices are taken cyclically in the latter statement. Since \(p\nmid
\sum_{i=1}^p a_i\) and \(p\) is an odd prime, there must exist a unique value of
\(k\) such that \[2k\sum_{i=1}^p a_i + \sum_{i=1}^p a_ia_{i+1} \equiv 0 \pmod{p}.\]
This proves the claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, the total number of good \(\textit{p}\)-tuples is \(\frac{1}{p}\)-th of the
number of close \(\textit{p}\)-tuples. Constructive counting gives us a count of
\(p^{p-1} \left(p-1\right)\) close \(\textit{p}\)-tuples, so the number of good
\(p\)-tuples is \(p^{p-2} \left(p-1\right)\).

solution by analyzing a small subset of the problem. Clearly, the third
condition is the hardest to deal with, so we try to only focus on the first two
conditions, leading to the idea of a &amp;quot;close&amp;quot; \(\textit{p}\)-tuple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, experimentation should lead to the key observation that only one
cyclic shift for any close \(\textit{p}\)-tuple satisfies the third condition.

there are more blue squares than red squares in the column. Determine the

width of the board, and \(m\geq n\), we claim that \[
M = m + \left\lfloor\frac{m\cdot\left\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rfloor}{\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor + 1}\right\rfloor,\]
where \(\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor\) denotes the greatest positive integer less than or
equal to \(x\). We do not have to worry about cases when \(m&amp;lt;n\), since by the
symmetry fo the board, we can get an \(m\times n\) board from an \(n\times m\) board
by rotating the board \(90^\circ\) and swapping the colors of all the squares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We begin by showing that \(r + b \leq M\). Suppose FTSOC that \(r+b&amp;gt;M\). Let
\(r+b=M+t\), where \(t\) is some positive integer. Note that since \(r\leq n\) and
\(M+t-r=b\leq m\), we have \[ M+t-m \leq r \leq n.\] Now consider a coloring with
\(r\) red-dominated rows and \(b=M+t-m\) blue-dominated columns. Since there are
\(m\) squares in a row, at least \(r\cdot\left(\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}
        \right\rfloor + 1\right)\) squares must be red. Similarly, at least
        \(b\cdot\left(\left\lfloor\frac{n} {2}\right\rfloor + 1\right)\) must be
        blue. However, notice that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad r\cdot\left(\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor + 1\right) + b\cdot\left(\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor + 1\right) \\

    \geq&amp;amp;\quad\left(M+t-m\right)\left(\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor - \left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor\right) + \left(M + t\right)\left(\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor + 1\right)\\
    =&amp;amp;\quad\left(M+t\right)\left(\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor + 1\right) - m\cdot\left(\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor - \left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor\right)\\

    =&amp;amp;\quad mn,
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;where the equality \(\left\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor +
1 = n\) can easily be derived by trivial casework on the parity of \(n\). This is a
contradiction, as the sum of the minimum numbers of red and blue squares exceeds
the total number of squares in the grid. Hence, \[r + b \leq M.\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we show that a coloring of the board exists such that \(r + b = M\). We
color the board in steps. First, color \(\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor + 1\) of the
rows in the grid blue and the remainder red. Then, note there are \(mn -
m\cdot\left(\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor + 1\right) = m\cdot\left\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}
\right\rfloor\) remaining red squares, some of which can be swapped with blue squares
in other rows such that each pair being swapped remains within the same column.
In particular, dividing the total number of red squares by the number of squares
required to meet the quota of a red-dominated row, we see that we can have
exactly \(\left\lfloor\frac{m\cdot\left\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rfloor}{\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}
\right\rfloor + 1}\right\rfloor\) red-dominated rows. Since swapping remains within columns,
the number of blue-dominated columns remains invariant. It is now easy to see that
a coloring in fact exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, for an \(m\)-width, \(n\)-height board with \(m\geq n\), it is clear that
\[ M = m + \left\lfloor\frac{m\cdot\left\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\right\rfloor}{\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor + 1}\right\rfloor.\]
And specifically for odd \(m\), \(n\), 
\[ M = m + \left\lfloor\frac{m\cdot\left(n - 1\right)}{m + 1}\right\rfloor,\]
or simply \(M=m+n-2\) for \(m\geq n&amp;gt; 1\).
