circumscribed circle, and let \(A_1\), \(B_1\), and \(C_1\) be the midpoints of sides
\(BC\), \(CA\), and \(AB\), respectively. Point \(A_2\) is located on the ray \(OA_1\) so
that \(OAA_1\) is similar to \(OA_2A\). Points \(B_2\) and \(C_2\) on rays \(OB_1\) and
\(OC_1\), respectively, are defined similarly. Prove that lines \(AA_2\), \(BB_2\),
and \(CC_2\) are concurrent, i.e. these three lines intersect at a point.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main claim is that \(AA_2\), \(BB_2\), and \(CC_2\) are the symmedians of
\(\triangle{ABC}\). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WLOG, we show that \(AA_2\) is the \(A\)-symmedian of \(\triangle{ABC}\). By the
symmedian construction, it suffices to prove that \(\angle OBA_2 = 90^\circ =
\angle OCA_2\). The given similar triangles yield \[ OA_1 \cdot OA_2 = OA^2 =
OB^2.\] Then, we have \(OB^2 = OA_1 \cdot OA_2 \iff \frac{OB}{OA_1} = \frac{OA_2}
{OB}\) and \(\angle BOA_1 = \angle BOA_2\). Hence, triangles \(BOA_1\) and \(A_2OB\)
are similar. Since \(OA_1\) is the perpendicular bisector of side \(\overline{BC}\),
\(\angle OBA_2 = 90^\circ\). These arguments can be repeated for \(\angle OCA_2\),
so we get \(\angle OBA_2 = 90^\circ = \angle OCA_2\) as desired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\(BB_2\) and \(CC_2\) are then also symmedians of \(\triangle{ABC}\) and it is well
known that the symmedians of a triangle concur at the Lemoine point.

\cos\), and \( \tan\) buttons, and their inverses (the \( \arcsin\), \( \arccos\), and
\( \arctan\) buttons). The display initially shows \( 0\). Given any positive
rational number \( q\), show that pressing some finite sequence of buttons will
yield the number \( q\) on the display. Assume that the calculator does real
number calculations with infinite precision. All functions are in terms of
radians.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define the set \(\sqrt\mathbb{Q} \coloneqq \{\,q &amp;gt; 0 \mid q^2 \in \mathbb{Q}\, \}
\supset \mathbb{Q}\). Let us then define the functions \(f,g: \sqrt\mathbb{Q}
\to\sqrt\mathbb{Q}\) from the calculator buttons. We have \[f(r)
    \coloneqq \tan\left(\arcsin\left(\cos\left(\arctan r\right)\right)\right) =
    \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \arctan r\right) = \frac{1} {r},\] and \[g(r)
\coloneqq \cos\left(\arctan r\right) = \frac{1} {\sqrt{1 + r^2}}.\] Obviously
\(f\) is bijective because its inverse is defined as itself. On the other hand,
\(g\) is also bijective as its inverse is defined as \(g^{-1}(r) =
\tan\left(\arccos r\right) = \frac{\sqrt{1-r^2}}{r}\) where \(r\) is in the range
of \(g\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose we are given some number \(q\in\sqrt\mathbb{Q}\) to compute. Starting at
\(0\), we can first apply \(\cos\) to get \(1\). We then show that it is possible to
iteratively apply \(f\) and \(g\) a finite number of times to achieve \(q\). Since
\(f\) and \(g\) are bijective, this is equivalent to showing that we can
iteratively apply inverses \(f^{-1}\) and \(g^{-1}\) a finite number of times to
get from \(q\) to \(1\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define a function \(c: \sqrt \mathbb{Q} \to \sqrt \mathbb{Q}\)  as 
\[ c(q) \coloneqq 
\begin{cases}
    f^{-1}(q) = \frac{1}{q} &amp;amp; \text{if } q &amp;gt; 1 \\
    1 &amp;amp; \text{if } q = 1 \\
    g^{-1}(q) = \frac{\sqrt{1-r^2}}{r} &amp;amp; \text{if } 1 &amp;gt; q &amp;gt; 0
\end{cases}. \] We prove that \[
\underbrace{c(c(c(... c}_n(q) ...))) = 1,\] for some positive integer \(n\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Letting \(q = \sqrt\frac{a}{b} = \frac{\sqrt a}{\sqrt b}\), for relatively prime
\(a, b \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\), we get the following cases: If \(a &amp;gt; b\), then \(c(q) =
c\left(\frac{\sqrt a}{\sqrt b}\right) = \frac{\sqrt b} {\sqrt a}\). If \(a=b\),
then \(c(q) = 1\). If \(b &amp;gt; a\), then \[ c(q) = c\left(\frac{\sqrt a}{\sqrt b}
    \right) = \frac{\sqrt{1 - \frac{a}{b}}}{\sqrt\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt {b
- a}}{\sqrt a} .\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't need to consider when \(a = b\), since it clearly satisfies our claim.
Now consider the sum of the squares of the numerator and the denominator when
\(q\) maps to \(c(q)\). For \(q,\) this sum is initially \(a+b\). For \(c(q)\), we either
get \(b+a\) or \(b - a + a = b\). Since \(b + a\), \(b \leq a + b\), notice that every
application of \(c\) monotonically decreases this sum by a positive integer.
It is also impossible to have infinite applications of the first case where
this sum doesn't decrease, so enough applications of \(c\) must bring the sum
down until \(a = b = 1\), at which point we are done.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want nestings of functions to yield rational values, so there are certain
cases that scream \(\textit{don't go there!}\) Expressions like \(\sin \sqrt k\),
\(\cos \sqrt k\), \(\arcsin \frac{m\pi}{n}\), \(\arccos \frac{m\pi} {n}\), etc.  are
such examples. In particular, we don't want ratios of the sides of a traingle
holding factors of \(\pi\). The angle conditions can be a little more relaxed
because we can define the angle whose slope is some rational \(q\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it's rather clear that there will be two kinds of numbers that appear on the
calculator. Those that represent angles and those that represent side ratios.
To get all the rational numbers, we will most likely focus on extracting it
from side ratios. There is also alternation between angle values and ratio
values. Therefore, it's practically impossible to have a repeat of the same
kind of trig function; it must alternate between \(\sin\), \(\cos\), and \(\tan\) to
one of their inverses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can try listing all possible ways of mapping these functions to see what
happens. Begin with some triangle side ratio \(t\) (not necessarily rational).
\(t\) can map to the following:
\[\begin{align*}
    f_1(t) &amp;amp;= \cos\left(\arctan t\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + t^2}} \\
    f_2(t) &amp;amp;= \sin\left(\arctan t\right) = \frac{t}{\sqrt{1 + t^2}} \\
    f_3(t) &amp;amp;= \tan\left(\arcsin t\right) = \frac{t}{\sqrt{1 - t^2}} \\
    f_4(t) &amp;amp;= \tan\left(\arccos t\right) = \frac{\sqrt{1 - t^2}}{t}
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will now try to get all the rationals. Consider what it means for some
rational number \(m\) to be \(\textit{computable}.\) If it were computable, then
persumably, from the above logic, it will come out of one of \(f_1(t)\), \(f_2(t)\),
\(f_3(t)\), or \(f_4(t)\). So let's just see what happens when we let \[ m = f_1(t)
. \]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the relation to hold, we must have
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad m = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + t^2}} \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad m^2\left(1 + t^2\right) = 1 \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad m^2t^2 = 1 - m^2 \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad t^2 = \frac{1 - m^2}{m^2} \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad t = \frac{\sqrt{1 - m^2}}{m},
\end{align*}\]
where each equation above is bidirectional since \(m\), \(t &amp;gt; 0\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if \(m\) is computable, then \(t\) must again be computable from one of \(f_1\),
\(f_2\), \(f_3\), or \(f_4\). We can then try the above method again, reach another
value \(t_1\), and send that back into, say \(f_1\), and so on. Once we hit a value
we know for certain is computable, then we know that unwinding all the
operations should give us a valid way to compute \(m\). This can be seen for the
value \(q = \frac{4}{5}\) below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[q = \frac{4}{5} \ {\color{blue} \to} \ \frac{3}{4} \ {\color{blue} \to} \
\frac{\sqrt 7}{3} \ {\color{blue} \to} \ \frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 7} \
{\color{blue} \to} \ \frac{\sqrt 5}{\sqrt 2} \ {\color{red} \to} \
\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 5} \ {\color{blue} \to} \ \frac{\sqrt 3}{\sqrt 2} \
{\color{red} \to} \ \frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 3} \ {\color{blue} \to} \
\frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \ {\color{blue} \to} \ 1 \ {\to} \ 0\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blue arrows indicate computing \(t\) from \(m\) as above. The red arrows
indicate computing the reciprocal.

Find, with proof, all sequences \(x_1, x_2, \dots,
x_{n-1}\) of positive integers with the following three properties: (a) \(x_1 &amp;lt;
x_2 &amp;lt; \dots &amp;lt; x_{n-1}\); (b) \(x_i + x_{n-i} = 2n\) for all \(i = 1, 2, \dots, n-1\);
(c) given any two indices \(i\) and \(j\) (not necessarily distinct) for which \(x_i
+ x_j &amp;lt; 2n\), there is an index \(k\) such that \(x_i + x_j = x_k\).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We claim that the answer is only the sequence \(2, 4, 6, \dots, 2n - 2\). It is
easy to verify that all of the conditions are met. (a) and (b) are trivial. To
verify (c), note that if we divide each of the terms by \(2\), the resulting
sequence is simply the sequence of integers from \(1\) to \(n-1\). Since \(x_i + x_j
&amp;lt; 2n\) is equivalent to \(\frac{x_i}{2} + \frac{x_j}{2} &amp;lt; n\), we know that there
exists some index \(k\) for which \(\frac{x_i}{2} + \frac{x_j}{2} = \frac{x_k}{2}\),
where \(\frac{x_k}{2}\) is one of the integers between \(1\) and \(n-1\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then show that this is the only sequence that works. We claim that
\[\begin{align*} 
    x_1 + x_{n-2} &amp;amp;= x_{n-1} \\
    x_1 + x_{n-3} &amp;amp;= x_{n-2} \\
                  &amp;amp;\vdots \\
    x_1 + x_2 &amp;amp;= x_3.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin, note that \[x_1 &amp;lt; x_2 \iff x_1 + 2n - x_2 &amp;lt; 2n \iff x_1 + x_{n-2} &amp;lt;
2n. \] By condition (c), there exists some term whose sum is \(x_1 + x_{n-2}\).
Since \(x_1 + x_{n-2} &amp;gt; x_{n-2},\) the only possibility is \(x_{n-1}\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, observe that \(x_{n-3} &amp;lt; x_1 + x_{n-3} &amp;lt; x_1 + x_{n-2} = x_{n-1} &amp;lt; 2n\) so
it follows that \(x_1 + x_{n-3} = x_{n-2}\). Repeating the logic \(n-3\) more times,
we discover that the system of equations in the claim holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now show that \(x_2 = 2x_1\). We have
\[\begin{align*}
    &amp;amp;\quad x_1 + x_{n-2} = x_{n-1} \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad x_1 + 2n - x_2 = 2n - x_1 \\
    \iff&amp;amp;\quad x_2 = 2x_1.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substituting the above into our equations and iteratively substituting
thereafter, we find that \(x_2 = 2x_1\), \(x_3 = 3x_1\), \(\dots\), \(x_{n-2} = (n-2)x_1\),
and \(x_{n-1} = (n-1)x_1\). Since \(2n - x_1 = x_{n-1} = (n-1)x_1\), we derive that
\(x_1 = 2\). Therefore the only sequence is \(2, 4, 6, \dots, 2n-2\).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;\(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;oly&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we derive the main claim that \(x_1 + x_{n-i} = x_{n-i+1}\) for each \(1 &amp;lt; i
&amp;lt; n - 1\), the rest of the solution becomes details. The motivation for the key
claim is to realize that the sum with the maximal gap between terms is
extremely (no pun intended) well-defined. Then, it's easy to \(\textit{tip}\) the
dominoe to get all the other equalities. This is a nice problem where analyzing
extremities does wonders.
