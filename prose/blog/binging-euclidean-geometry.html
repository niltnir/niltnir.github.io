are gradually taking over my life.</p><p>After publishing the initial site, I decided to take a break from code to do
something else for a while. At first I was considering doing some drawing or
solving combinatorics problems, but strangely enough, I found myself picking up
a geometry book I bought some years ago.</p><p>If you've read my math page, you'll know that I enjoy discrete math, so it was
quite odd for me to suddenly crave for geometry. Perhaps the appeal was the
pretty diagrams I got to draw with compass and straightedge. I admit, there is
a certain meditative quality in patiently turning words into pictures.</p><p>But this was the tip of the iceberg. As I slowly made way through the book,
propositions, theorems, and lemmas, flew onto sheets of paper. As I slowly got
acquainted with these objects, I started solving problems. Soon I was craving
to get past the theory to fly straight into the wild west of exhilarating
problems.</p><p>One fun problem<label for="sn-437075-861527" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-437075-861527" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The solution can be found elsewhere while I slowly commit to digital writeups.</span> I was immediately confronted with was the
following:</p><em>Given a circle and a point inside of it, take all the chords through the point
and aggregate their midpoints. Prove that the resulting figure is a circle with
its diameter defined between the point and the center of the circle.</em><p>The beauty of Euclidean geometry lies in its simple character. There are no
crazy equations<label for="sn-513952-416969" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-513952-416969" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">With the exceptions of rectilinear coordinates, complex numbers, barycentric coordinates, linear algebra, etc.</span>, no confusing
objects, no fancy notation, yet results are often astonishing. No wonder it's
called the <strong>king</strong> of mathematics. I guess in this sense, it's closer to the
elegance of discrete math than it is to something like algebra or analysis.</p><p>Unfortunately, geometry gets a bad rap in conventional education and other
academic institutions. It's often written off as &quot;useless&quot; and &quot;trivial&quot; by
many. In fact, Euclidean geometry is a dead topic among professional
mathematicians despite its historical origins. In a way though, the topic is a
hidden gem—detached from the world, only showing itself to those who seek it.</p><p>It's often hard as a beginner to recognize the depth to which something simple
manifests. When I tried getting into geometry years ago, the theory seemed too
&quot;fundamental&quot; and the problems too &quot;similar&quot;. Only now do I appreciate the true
depth that this humble subject has to offer. This is especially true after
solving neat, challenging Olympiad problems.</p><p>Of course, now that I have pages filled with diagrams of problems and solutions,
it only worsens my ever-increasing queue of &quot;math to convert to LaTeX&quot;.
Diagrams are also more tedious because it requires additional tools like
Asymptote.</p><p>Nonetheless, geometry has a new place in my heart. Gone are the days of <em>yet
another find the length problem</em>. It's a field where more of its magic is
revealed the deeper you go. But go too far, and you'll start looking for
concyclic points in stars and raindrops.<label for="sn-256788-676314" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-256788-676314" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">My record is dreaming up diagrams in my sleep, and apparently this is a phenomenon called the Tetris effect. Besides geometric diagrams and Tetris blocks, I've also dreamt of Lisp code.</span></p><p>That's pretty much what I've been up to lately. Excuse my bad writing, this is
being written at 4 AM in the morning. ;p</p></article></article></section></section><footer id="page-footer"><div id="footer-right"><small xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/"><a property="dct:title" rel="cc:attributionURL" href="/legal.html">This website</a> is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1" target="_blank" rel="license noopener noreferrer" style="display:inline-flex;">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International</a>  •  © 2023 Lynn Noda</small></div></footer></body>
